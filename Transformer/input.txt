after 9 years and countless theories thecrying child's name has been foundthat's right on screen right now is thereal name of FNAF 4's crying child andby the end of this episode you're goingto know exactly which one itis hello Internet welcome to Game Theorythe show that's just desperately tryingto keep up with the FNAF content trainit feels like there's been a lot rightwe had all that stuff from the 10thanniversary we've had our first fullentry into the Choose Your Own Adventurestyle book series there's even a FNAFlevel in the new Funko Fusion game Iswear if there is law in this thing I amgoing to scream but while I was busyjust trying to keep on top of all ofthat someone else decided that it wouldbe fun to add one final slice to myalready oversized mountain of lore Pizzafellow theorist and friend of thechannel hyperd Droid now normallyanother theorist posting a theory oftheir own doesn't particularly slow medown I'd normally finish writing whatI'm doing and then I'd go back and watchthat later but this one was differentbecause he claimed he'd done theimpossible he claimed that after yearsof speculation he'd finally found thename of the cryingchild that is a massive claim especiallywhen so many others had tried and failedin the past but it wasn't all talk hebacked it up with some pretty solidevidence that the fan base seemed tolove we were inundated with messages onour subreddit Twitter Youtube commentsall asking us one thing is he right andI get it hyper Droid is a fantastictheorist but this particular puzzle haseluded us for so long to the point wheremost of us just thought it would neverbe solved if he is right and we're allgoing to start calling the crying childsomething other than the crying child wewant to make sure it stands up toscrutiny don't want to be caught backingthe wrong animatronic horse so let's gothrough the evidence he's presented themethods he's used and see whether thisnew name holds water ladies andgentlemen it's um huh can't use Mortyanymore can way and doesn't look likeMatt's going to be interrupting me thistime got to come up with something newoh I know leave your theories in thecomments below I'll pick my favorite inthe next episode of trash yeah that'sabout right I guess that's what happenswhen I let Yosi pick the acronym let'sgive a trash take then shall we tounderstand how hyper Droid came to findthis new name we first need to recapwhere the mystery started the survivallog book after the release of FNAF 6 wegot this book that seemed to just be akids puzzle book but it turned out to beone of the biggest law clues in theentire series and I really do mean thatinside we have three characters talkingto us Mike Aton writing in red pen aghostly Spirit writing in faded text anda final Spirit altering the physicaltext of the book across several PagesThe Faded text wrote the words my nameand on one page my name was written on agravestone this reflected the fifthgravestone with no name that we found atthe end of FNAF 6 thanks to Reddit useryou powerful one we realized that youcould take the altered numbers on thepages where the words my name were foundand use those as coordinates for theword search giving us the name Cassidythe fifth missing child this and ofitself was a huge dub for the FNAFCommunity but it was kind of bittersweetbecause there was another puzzle in thisbook that remained unsolved the foxygrid this grid had faded letters in thefirst few boxes showing us that weneeded to fill in the rest and likelymeaning we needed more coordinates tofigure out a new name the name of thespirit writing an altered text in thebook based on Cassidy's questions aboutthe Purple Plastic telephone psychicfriend fredbear as well as a birthdayparty that was for you all things seemto be pointing to this final spiritbeing FNAF for's crying child the foxygrid was going to finally help us figureout the name of this character theproblem was nobody could Solve IT Mattwas literally ripping his hair out foryears over this thing some people triedto find the name in other places andthen reverse engineer a solution in helpwanted the FNAF bedroom was calledNorman bedroom so maybe Norman somepeople thought Garrett because that'sMike's brother in the recent movie someeven thought it might be Gregory becausehe's designed in a similar way to thecrying child but none of them were ableto link it back to the foxy grid and soit just felt inconclusive a few Redditusers found the phrase is springtrapusing six Cassidy coordinates and six myname page numbers this seemed to pairnicely with my name because it matchedthe FNAF 3 teaser my name is springtrapand implied therefore that the ghostlyTex next was actually Aton speaking tothe crying child whose name wouldtherefore be Cassidy but sadly thissolution ignores the seventh coordinateneeded to make up the name Cassidy inthe first place and so by cherry pickingsix of the coordinates it kind of causesthe whole thing to fall apart finallythe most simple and well-known of thetheories was offered by Reddit userWolfie 1740 Kingdom they matched thequestions that Cassidy was asking to theanswers given by the crying child inAltered text the party was for you itwas for me what do you see I can't seedoes he still talk to you I can hearsounds this gave them the letters e vand a but they weren't really able tofigure out the final letter anotherReddit user Godzilla 81315 did manage tofind a solution they added up the tallymarks to give them the final coordinates39 leading to the letter n and the nameEvan a lot of people really liked thisname and thought it was an interestingTheory but because you had to break themethod on that final letter it was justtoo tough a moon drop to swallow enterhyperd Droid he too liked the initialmethod posed by Wolfie but he agreedthat the final letter would need tofollow the same method especially ascrying child does offer a fourth answerI'm scared so he took the same threeanswers to get the letters e v and a butrather than skipping the fourth answerhe tried to match it to another one ofthe questions on page 41 Cassidy asks doyou have dreams initially that doesn'tseem to make a lot of sense given theresponse but underneath that questionMike has drawn a picture of nightmarethe nightmare animat ronics came fromWilliams experiments on his kids andit's been theorized that this is whatwas used to make the crying child scaredof the animatronics INF FNAF 4 thatmeans the crying child would not onlyknow what this is but would also beafraid of it leading to him giving theseemingly non-direct answer I'm scaredtaking the page number for that questionyou can plug it into the foxy grid andget the letter D spelling IAD thennoticing all the references the book hadto reflecting along with the randommirror next to the word search that'snever been used for anything h Hy Droidreflected the answer giving them thecrying child's name d a v eDave everybody lost their frontal loesover this but hyper Droid wasn't donenot only did he offer the initialsolution he also went Classic GameTheory on all of us and used some realworld evidence he calls out that Dave ormore accurately the full name David wasthe third to fifth most popular babyname for boys between 1970 and 19 1980around the time that he would have beenborn I love the fact he did this realworld evidence is so useful for Theorycrafting it can give you insight intothings that the games or books mightotherwise not and given how importantthis name is I wouldn't be surprised ifScott had actually done some real worldresearch himself into the name andwhat's more I think we can actuallyexpand upon hyperd droid's idea here bygetting a little more specific so let'sgive it a go FNAF is commonly depictedas taking place in Hurricane Utahaccording to the United States SocialSecurity Administration between 1970 and1980 David switched positions a fewtimes occupying either the fourth thethird the second or the first mostpopular spots higher than what hyperdDroid presented so we're off to a prettygood start although there is one detailabout the aons that we never really talkabout that could change all of this lwigactually mentioned it when he binged allof the FNAF law with Matt on stream Mattwhy are they British why are theyBritish the kids are raced in like Utahand they sound British when the at speakthey sound British likely somewhere fromEngland based on the accents I'd like tosay it's nice to have some Britishrepresentation in video games but I'mnot really sure this is the one I'd wantto claim anyway this detail could throwa spanner into the works as there's achance that William named his kids basedon what was popular back home ratherthan where they lived now so was Davidstill a popular name in the UKthankfully the answer is ABS freakinglutely more so than in America actuallyaccording to the office of nationalstatistics David was the most popularname for Boys in England from 1954 to1974 after that between 1974 and 1994 itonly dropped down to number three sostill this is looking like a prettysolid piece of evidence right now pluswe can actually take it a step furtherwant to guess what other name was in thetop 10 baby boy names during the' 70sMichael in the UK Michael was the ninthmost popular name for a boy and in Utahit was literally the number one nameevery year in the '70s except 1973 whereit was overtaken by Jason God of courseJason had to ruin the perfect streak #blame Jason am I right regardless againthis seems to be lining up pretty wellbut what about the final afon childElizabeth well she is also on theselists although she's nowhere near aspopular in the UK for that time she wassitting between 20th and 25th mostpopular name and in Utah it's similaranywhere between 19th to 24th that's notreally as high as I'd like for it tofeel like a solid connection it isn'tsuper bad it would be way worse if thenames were like 50th or 100th mostpopular you know but if this is beingused as evidence for how Scott pickedhis names then Elizabeth would likelyneed to follow that same pattern and inreality she'd have then ended up beingcalled something like Sarah or Jenniferboth number one names for the timeperiod in the UK and Utah respectivelytherefore while David was a reallypopular name between the 1970s and ' 80sit kind of feels like a weakerconnection maybe Scott just thoughtElizabeth sounded more British becausethat was the queen at the time who knowsno need to worry though because thatwasn't the only real world evidencehyper Droid used He also mentioned themeaning of the name David while it was apopular name in both the UK and the USit's actually of Hebrew origin meaningbeloved fun fact Thomas also comes froma Hebrew word that means twin I'm not atwin at least as far as I know maybe youcould let me know down in the commentsif you think you found my long lost twinfor this Theory though hyper Droidclaims that the meaning does make sensehe connects the meaning of beloved tothe crying child's brother Mike and howhis whole character Arc is caused bykilling his brother showing us that hisbrother Dave was beloved by him this iswhere I have to press X to doubt wellyes Michael does say sorry to hisbrother by the end of FNAF 4 the rest ofhis actions don't really say that heconsidered his brother beloved he jumpscares him he actively puts him into ananimatronic he doesn't seem to careabout him at all after that his actionsseem to be spurred on More by his fatherafon sent him down into sister locationwhere he then learned about Elizabethand the monster his father was and sowent on a quest to destroy him some ofthat may have come from the guilt ofkilling his brother but I'm just notconvinced enough to say that Michaelconsidered his brother beloved now thatdoesn't mean that I think the meaningDavid being beloved is invalid evidenceat all he may not have been beloved byMichael but he was beloved by someoneelse William William didn't want hislittle boy gone he didn't want him todie he needed to save him I will put youback together we've also believed for along while that he killed Charlie in adrunken or emotional rage after thedeath of his own son that wouldn'thappen if he didn't care about his kidif his son wasn't beloved and byassociating that meaning with afon otherpieces fall into place for the otherAfton kids as well Michael once againcomes from the Hebrew language and itmeans who is like God typically this ismeant as a rhetorical question becausethere is no one like God but it couldalso be interpreted as a statementMichael who is like God William is a manwho has figured out power over life anddeath in this world world he seeshimself as a God and Mike tells ushimself that the Funtime animatronicsconfuse him for his father they didn'trecognize me at first but then theythought I was you he is like his fatherhe is who is like God the same thinggoes for the name Elizabeth it's derivedfrom the Hebrew name elisheva and meansmy God is a promise one of the onlylines we get from Elizabeth before shebecomes baby is her begging William tolet her play with baby oh Dad you let mego to her didn't you make her just forme baby was made by afon for Elizabethshe's annoyed because she is now beingdenied the thing made specifically forher the thing that was promised to herby her father by the God of this worldafter that she disobeyed and got scoopedand so Aton made her another promise thesame one he made the crying child hesent Michael down into the bunker to puther back together three Afton kids threeHebrew names three meanings that allpoint back towards dear old dad it'slike poetry it's like poetry it's sortof they rhy interestingly William isn'tof Hebrew origin it's actually Germanicbut it also has an interesting meaningResolute protector or strong willedWarrior he tried to protect Elizabeth hewas Resolute in fixing and protectingthe crying child after he died and ifyou don't call surviving a springlocking strong W I don't know what elseyou'd call it so from a thematicstandpoint the name Dave does seem towork its meaning fits what we know ofthe character and it ties into the samethemes as the rest of the afon familyit's at this point though I shouldprobably address the oral in the roomreal world research is great and strongconnecting themes are fantastic piecesof supplementary evidence but that's thepoint they're supplementary if the coreevidence isn't there to back it up inthe first place then it don't mean squatit all comes down to the actual methodthat hyper Droid used to solve thispuzzle and I'll be honest when I firstsaw it I was a little unsure using thefaded text of the party was for you andwhat do you see make complete sense forthe answers it was for me and I can'tsee I can hear sounds technically workswith does he still talk to you thoughit's not the cleanest but I'm scaredbeing a response to do you have dreamsdoes feel like a bit of a stretch theline only works because of the nightmaredrawing on the same page even thoughnone of the other questions need contextclues from the page this feeling wasalso exacerbated when hyper Droidpointed back to a Reddit post by theuser ecstatic maripan 7 from the GTsubreddit they came up with a solutionthree years ago so way to represent theGT Community but when I took a look atthe original post they were receivingsimilar push back people were commentingthe same things that I'm saying nowhowever we theorists are nothing if notthorough we always dot our eyes andcross RTS rather than just say thisanswer feels wrong and throwing thewhole thing out I wanted to go backthrough the log book and do a bit of myown reverse engineering I marked downevery page number where Cassidy wrotesomething in the log book I then usedthose page numbers in the foxy grid tofind all the possible letters we couldget to see if any of them gave us usableanswers that we could then go back andpair with I'm scared two of them gotruled out immediately what do youremember and do you miss them becausethey're on pages 20 and 70 you can't gozero down on a grid so they're out onpage 56 we get was your favorite ridethat Carousel but that spells vve sothat's out too three of cassy'squestions do you give us letters thattechnically work do you remember yourname is on page 31 do any of these toyslook familiar to you is on page 42 anddid one of these belong to you is onpage 43 31 gives us a c 42 gives us a wand 43 gives us a p using these lettersyou can spell cave wave and pave allreal words but not exactly namesespecially considering the very Norm AlMike and Elizabeth although page 43isn't actually labeled as 43 it's one ofthe altered page numbers and it shows 15so I tried that too and it gave me yaaveanother dud the only time I got close toanother answer was by using page 23which ironically gives you an N spellingEvan was Wolfie actually right all thoseyears ago yeah no if you thought do youhave dreams made no sense with I'mscared I feel like what was yourfavorite childhood toy plastic telephoneis an even worse answer it would thenmean we haven't reversed anything eitherand so the mirror in the middle of thebook would also remain unused whichisn't really ideal the last page to trywas 83 where Cassidy asks is this songfamiliar to you this gives you a tea inthe foxy grid and I tried using this asboth an alternative for I'm scared aswell as I can hear sounds just to besure but no combination of those lettersmade a name either which means byprocess of eliminationdo you have dreams does kind of have tobe the answer if it's not we also haveto throw out the letters EV and a tobecause we need to find an entirely newmethod to solve this grit and at thispoint I kind of feel like if there wasanother method someone surely would havefound it by now I'm sure that somepeople still aren't going to be happywith this solution for all the otherquestions crying child was justresponding to the words Cassidy said butfor this final one you have to useMike's drawing to get the fullinterpretation as I've already said thatkind of breaks the method not as much asfinding the N for Ev using the tallymarks did but enough that it doesn'tfeel satisfying except when you stop andlook back Scott actually did the samething with the Cassidy puzzle thinkabout it at the start we were usingaltered page numbers from pages with myname written on them but as the puzzlewent on that changed suddenly we stoppedusing altered page numbers and beganusing other altered numbers from thepage like 7 and 2 or 10 and 11 on somepages we're not even using alterednumbers one of them we use numberswritten by Mike a completely differentcharacter and on another you have tofollow Mike's clue to a different pageand then use the numbers that are justin the book They're not altered they'renot written down they're just there wewere still following the my name part ofthe puzzle but the actual number usedfor the coordinates was different thatrule was being broken and yet no onereally battered an eyelid when that waspitched out why because we got an answerthat made sense yes the method was alittle messy but clearly it was thecorrect solution that Scott had plannedgiven he then went on to confirm thename Cassidy in his canceled movie ideasto me this is the same situation wefinally have an answer that spells aname and follows the same kind ofpuzzles even if the method is a littlemessy maybe Scott wanted to make thepuzzles harder as they went on or youknow maybe he just isn't that good atplanning puzzles to begin with wetheorists are so used to complex ciphersand args that sometimes I think weexpect everything we solve to be on thatlevel but in actualitynot everyone is and so the simplestSolutions can actually be the best allthat being said what do I actually thinkis Dave the real name of the cryingchild well even though a little messythe solution does fit it gives an answerfor the random mirror in the middle ofthe book and it works thematically withall of the afon children and their partsin the story is crying child's name Davefor me after spending days going backand forth back and forth looking atevery side of the AR argument I have tosay that the answer is a resounding yesI believe that Dave is the name of thecrying child so to hyper Droid ecstaticmaripan 7 and any other FNAF theoristthat came up with this solution over theyears congratulations you did it yousolved the foxy grid and you got thetheorist seal of approval editor cue theApplause so nice to give one of theseout especially to people like ecstaticmaripan 7 who so this thing over 3 yearsago it's a helpful reminder that thereare some fantastic theorists out therewe just need to be open to hearing themout wher they're a tiny channel here onYouTube a small post on a subreddit withonly two up votes or a random reply on aDiscord server they can have ideas thatare just as good as any one of us biggerchannels it may go against our ownpersonal head cannons but if thisexperience has taught us anything it'snot to Discount those ideas just becausethey're a little out there give them achance who knows they might actuallyhave the Solutions we've all beenlooking for but hey that's just a theorya game theory thanks for watching and ifyou're looking for more FNAF Theoryreviews just buy of 83 the video onscreen to watch our reaction to dualprocess theories Theory review awaytheoristsRoblox doors Floor 2 has arrived and itis hard no no no no no I'm getting eatenno what the heck I'm dead I'm dead wheredid the Sparkles go they're so commondown here but while all of us creatorswere distracted focusing on the newlevels and enemies the doors devsquietly made some graphical changes tothe original Floor One locations andwhat they added changes everything thatwe know about the LW of this franchiselet's just say if you guys thought themines were hell you ain't seen nothingyet hello Internet welcome to GameTheory the show that's excited to havemore flaws for doors law that's rightthe Mind update for Roblox doors hasfinally arrived and behind every newdoor is a bunch of new LW to discoverit's like the best game show ever what'sbehind door number one law what's behinddoor number two more everybody winsespecially us with each new update weare being given more and more clues tosolve the story of this Mysterious Worldour current theory is that we areplaying in a hotel from the 1940s onethat was turned into a medical facilityduring World War II now it's haunted bythe spirits of those who died here aswell as a culty experiment or two butnot every Force has been an evil one ablue light known as Guiding Light ishelping us to escape the clutches ofthese evil monsters lighting up doorsgiving you items like the crucifix tohelp defend yourself and telling you howto avoid the monsters when you diethey're basically basically our GuardianAngel although according to thewingdings on The crucifixes BindingCircle they are actually known as anarchitect likely because they help guideus through the Labyrinth of doors inthis hotel a magical architect wouldprobably know the layout of the buildingeven if it never looks the same twicewhich leads us to today and all the lawthat is waiting for us down on floor 2on a surface level it's just a lot moreof the stuff you loved from the originaltry to walk through a 100 doors withoutdying to the various entities only thistime you're not in a hotel you're in a mshaft truly this is innovation thatexcites of course I'm kidding there is alot of great changes that have been madefor this update we've got new entitieslike the Gloom bats giggles and grumbleswe got new mechanics like the minecartpuzzles and chases exploding rooms andhidden codes to power generators we evenhave a platforming style boss battleagainst the main villain of this floorour old pal seek though he's clearly lethimself go a bit what happened to youman you were literally running after mea few floors ago you can't let losing tome get you like this especially when youhave been the missing piece of our lawpuzzle since the very beginning yepseeks rise from random end TAA finalboss battle isn't just for a change ofmechanics it's highlighting howimportant he is to the law of thisfranchise and that we have been wrong tonot have theorized about him sooner yeahthat's kind of my bad so grab your glowsticks friends because we're about toshed some light on the Mysteries hiddenin the minds of Roblox doors as I'vementioned this new floor has added a lotto this game but before we dive into thestuff going on there I wanted to checkout some of the changes this updatebrought to other parts of the game therehave been some minor tweaks like howsome entities spoil move around andinteract with the player throughout thehotel most of them have just beenquality of life changes that is exceptfor one the courtyard got a massivegraphical overhaul and the biggestdifference to me was that there is now apedestal placed in front of the angelstatue that we've been theorizing abouton that pedestal there is a code writtenin wingdings wingdings seem to be one ofthe ways that we are being given crucialinformation by the devs in thisfranchise last time they revealed hugedetails about Guiding Light and TheArchitects Through The cruci fix'sBinding Circle so whatever this says islikely going to be very important andindeed it is translating it gives us asingle word limbo limbo has a fewinterpretations in various religiouscultures but the most common andwell-known interpretation comes from aset of narrative poems Dante's DivineComedy Dante was a religious philosopherwho wrote These poems while he wasquestioning his own faith feeling likehe'd lost his way he wanted to explorethe ideas of Heaven and Hell and so hewrote poems about him traveling throughthose worlds first up was the poemDante's Inferno where he goes throughthe Nine Circles of Hell limbo is thevery first Circle and those who residethere were generally considered goodpeople but were not baptized or fromother religious backgrounds even thoughthey weren't Christian because they weregood they were saved from the torture ofthe lower circles of hell Dantetherefore describes Lim Bo as a greenand Luscious landscape separated fromThe Real World by a large river andwithin its Woods is a flowing Brook anda castle but why am I telling you thisoutside of the word limbo beingmentioned on the Statue it doesn'treally seem like there's any connectionwith Dante's Divine Comedy that is untilyou get through door 200 and escape themines as we climb up the ladder we findourselves in a forest behind us is alarge river that separates us from anyother Land We cross a flowing Brook andfinally we arrive at you guessed it acastle coincidence I think not this gameisn't taking place in a real world Hotellike we first believed we are in theafterlife and yes I know the creatorshave said this game isn't religious butwhen they keep adding religious imagesand languages like this what's atheorist supposed to do this place beinglimbo would explain so much of whatwe've been seeing the afterlife inDante's Divine Comedy is described asphysically impossible in many waysdefying all laws of physics and logicsuddenly The Impossible construction ofthe hotel the M shaft the sewers it'sall possible if this isn't a real hotelfrom the 1940s but instead part of theafterlife plus the connections to limbodon't stop there in a previous Theory wespoke about El goblino and how he seemsto be a perfect match for a creaturefrom Spanish-speaking folklore the dendethey are gnome or goblin-like creaturesWho hide in the walls to try to scarehumans just like El goblino doesthroughout your run in the hotel but thekey detail is that the dende arecommonly the spirits of infants thathave died before they were baptized andone of the common sites in Dante's limbois exactly that infants who weren'tbaptized their Spirits weren't cleansedof original sin and so now they areforced to wander for eternity with nochance of Escape although that doesn'tseem to be the case for us we aren'tsitting around letting eternity pass Usby we are actively trying to escape insome way getting through the 100 Doorsof the hotel and the 100 Doors of themines all with the help of guiding lightwhy Guiding Light has been helping usand not any of these other poor trappedSpirits has been unclear at best butwith these connections to Dante's DivineComedy I think we might have an answerit's important to know that even thoughthe Divine Comedy takes place in theafterlife Dante himself isn't actuallydead he had simply lost his way he wasquestioning his faith which led tobeings from heaven like the Virgin Maryand St Lucia to send him a spiritualguide to help him get through the ninecircles of hell as well as purgatory andeventually heaven all with the hope thatafter he returns to the mortal world hewill be enlightened and find his wayagain so they send the soul of thefamous Roman poet Vergil to do just thatVirgil becomes Dante's guide explainingthe different circles as they go andhelping him Traverse the confusinglandscape this is a perfect parallel forGuiding Light for a while we believedthat this angel statue we saw in thecourtyard was Guiding Light in physicalform the guardian angel that was goingto help us through the game however oncewe translated the wingdings from thecruci fix's binding Circle we've beenless and less sure about whether that'sthe case it refers to Guiding Light asone of three Architects marked bycelestials last time we spoke about howthe term Celestial or Celestial beingshas been used throughout history todescribe angels and other Heavenlybeings The Guiding Light has beenspecifically referred to as somethingelse and now we know why Guiding Lightisn't a Celestial or angel or Heavenlybeing they are a spirit sent by thecelestials to guide us through limbolike Virgil was sent by the Virgin Marythat's why Guiding Light is helping usand not the other entities we see theother entities are the spirits of theDead their fate has been sealed they areunable to go back to the world of theliving but we aren't dead yet we're justvisiting the afterlife and Guiding Lightis the one to help us get through itthat doesn't mean we're done with thisangel statue no sir read if it isn'tGuiding Light then it does feel like itneeds to be someone else otherwisewhat's the point of not only includingthe angel statue to be with but alsogiving it a massive glow up during thisupdate oh yeah it's not just thepedestal in front of the statue thatchanged the actual statue has beenaltered dramatically rather than thismassive angel with its face shrouded indarkness wings that curve around itsbody and a two-handed sword stance wenow have a much more open and obviousvisual the angel now stands in atriumphant pose its sword held with onehand and four wings spread out wide wecan also see its face and though it'splain it does have have a band of eyescircling it this depiction matches whatwe get from the prophet Ezekiel in theBible in chapter 10 he describescherubim as creatures with four wingsand so many eyes that they cover everypart of their body yeah not quite thecute little baby angels we often seethem depicted as and the reason they hadhundreds of eyes like this was becausethe cherubim were responsible forguarding and protecting what belonged toGod they were warriors they had to keepwatch and see everything it's a prettysolid match for us statue here althoughwhen I got thinking about hundreds ofeyes it did remind me of another entityin this game that also has hundreds ofeyes and likes to keep watch one that Imentioned right at the start of thisepisode in the main lobby of the hotelyou can find these white eyes with blackgoop hidden around the room constantlywatching you during any of your runsthere is a chance that at a random Pointyou'd begin to see these eyes appearonce again on the walls the further youwent the more and more eyes appeareduntil eventually you would enter a largehallway where out of a puddle of blackgoo seek would emerge to chase you downthey then return in the mines update toonce again chase us they also become agiant goo monster as part of the finallevel and in this form they are coveredin dozens of eyes seek is constantlybeing shown to be an entity withhundreds of eyes connected to them andthey have been watching us throughoutthe hotel and the mines just like thecherubim use their eyes to keep watchfor Dangerous threats that's righttheorists I am telling you that Ibelieve our goopy boy seek is in fact anangel like the one we see in the courtyard one of the entities that this gamecalls a Celestial I know it soundsridiculous lots of eyes aren't the onlything that makes an angel an angel andoutside of that detail seek looksnothing like the angel we see in thecourtyard plus angels are supposed to begood right they're here to defend andprotect the innocent it's the celestialsthat gave us Guiding Light to help usand he actively guides US during se'sChase sequence he blocks se's path witha blue seal over the door he even makesa car appear beneath us to help usEscape Guiding Light and seek are onopposite sides and if Guiding Light ison the side of the Heavenly celestialsthen seek cannot be an angel or so youwould think until you remember theinspiration that comes from Dante'sInferno right now we are in theafterlife in limbo during his time inHell Dante speaks to multiple angelsthat are stuck there although only oneof them gets top billing and he is alsodescribed as not quite looking like hisoriginal beautiful form Lucifer we'veactually talked about Lucifer before inone of our earlier theories we thoughtit was connected to curious light theyellow light and one of the otherArchitects that quote unquote helps usin the back door and room levels of thehotel but just like Guiding Light it'sclear that these Architects Are NotAngels themselves and so curious lightcannot be Lucifer don't worry little guywell figure you out eventually in caseyou're unaware Lucifer was originallyone of the highest ranking angels inheaven Ezekiel describes him as God'sanointed cherub aligning him with theStatue from the courtyard eventuallyLucifer became prideful and rebelledagainst God wanting all of the glory forhimself leading to him falling fromgrace and into the underworld in Dante'sInferno Lucifer's form is described asmonstrous deformed and hideous not likethe angelic appearance he had beforebeing cast out however despite this hedid maintain some of his angel-likefeatures most notably his multiple eyesso even though seek may not look like anangel the fact he shares one of the fewfeatures Lucifer maintained after hisFall From Grace certainly makes it seemlike these two are connected Lucifer hasalso been depicted as a creature madefrom black goo taking on a humanoid formin shows like Supernatural though I'mnot sure this specific detail isintentional maybe the devs are just fansof the show but I thought it wasinteresting to call nonetheless it ismore than just his appearance thoughseek also shares a lot of his power setwith Lucifer as well one of Lucifer'sPowers is that he's a shape shifterbecoming a snake to deceive Eve in theGarden of Eden as well as trickinghumans by appearing to be an angel ofLight when he is anything but likewiseseek is able to shape shift intowhatever he needs be it a humanoid a BigBlob or hundreds of arms that try tograb you as you escape Lucifer iscommonly associated with being able tocontrol fire due to his power over hellduring seek chase the entire Hotelbursts into flames and to top it all offin religious contexts Lucifer is shownto corrupt the minds and Souls of peopletricking them into sinning turning theminto worse versions of themselves andseek has been doing the exact same thingin the minds there's a new entity calleda giggle they are white tentacledmonsters with giant teeth that hang fromthe ceiling of dark rooms and jump scareyou you may notice that that soundsawfully similar to an entity from thehotel called Screech Screech also has awhite face tentacles large teeth andhides in dark rooms the only differenceis that Screech is partially covered inBlack goo seeks black goo the developersare showing us that seek is takingcontrol of entities like the giggles andcorrupting them turning them into evenworse monsters we actually see thishappen in real time at the end of thegame where seek absorbs the giantGrumble at the face of the castle and hehas the power to do all of this becausewe're in his domain in the Bible it issaid that God created hell for the deviland his minions to rule over likewisethe celestials made this version oflimbo for seek to rule over that's whythe angel statue with the word limbowritten next to it is standing in such atriumphant pose this is se's true form afour-winged multi-eyed cherub just likeLucifer he may have lost the battleagainst the other celestials but nowhe's been given this domain to rule andso there he stands proudly seek is afallen angel a cast out Celestial we areon his Turf which means that his poweris only going to get worse from herewhen Dante and Virgil enter the castleinside of limbo they find the spirits ofHistory's wisest men after spending sometime with them Dante and Virgil continueon their Journey heading to the secondCircle and continuing to go deeper anddeeper into hell until eventually theyreach the center of hell and come faceto face with Satan himself this Castleisn't going to be our safe Fortressinside there are going to be morepowerful spirits because we're actuallyheading deeper into limbo so if youthought the mines were a challenge youbetter get ready for even more pain noit was right there are you kidding me ohmy gosh dude and it's not going to stopat the castle either when you beat themines you unlock an achievement calledsee you soon like Dante we are going tobe heading deeper and deeper into thishell we find ourselves in and thatachievement is a message from seekpromising that they're going to keepfollowing us through hell and as they dothey are going to become more and moremore powerful we've actually alreadyseen this happen with the two floors wehave available in the hotel seek onlyhad one form and while he was able tomanipulate the space he could reallyonly chase us but now that we Fallenlower down into the mines he took on amuch bigger and larger form gaining evenmore power So eventually I could see usending up at hell's Center where seek isgoing to be at his strongest maybe we'lleven see him take on some of hisoriginal form but if we defeat him we'llfinally be able to escape and receivethe en Enlightenment whereafter ofcourse seek isn't going to take any ofthis lying down he's going to keeptrying to stop us on each floor beforewe get there in fact he's actually themost determined entity to try and stopyou entities like rash Halt and Ambushare just spirits that float through thehotel and kill you if they pass by sureYou' still end up dead but it'srelatively passive the figure while muchmore active is animalistic acting onsound and Instinct seek on the otherhand is different seek actively chasesyou he creates obstacles to stop yougetting away and when Guiding Light putsa seal over the door he continuallybangs on it trying desperately to get toyou this felt like a crucial distinctionfor se's law but I couldn't reallyfigure out why he acted differently doeshe not want you to reach Enlightenmentis it that he believes nobody should beable to leave the afterlife once they'rethere maybe it's because you're in hisdomain and he simply wants to remove theIntruder that's basically the plot ofthe tower Hero's crossover event to keepthe humans out but then again that eventisn't Cannon so can't really rely onthat either however if you so happen todie to seek while in third person modewe finally get our answer normally whenyou die you just fall over but with seekyour body quickly turns black and wehear a modified version of se's cry weare being covered in se's Black goo justlike we've seen with the giggles in thequeen Grumble he is trying to take overour body and what's more I think I knowwhy remember in Dante's Inferno Dantewasn't bound to the afterlife he wasmerely visiting we we are merelyvisiting we are the only ones who havethe ability to freely travel through thedifferent Realms of Hell purgatory andat the very end of D's Divine ComedyEven Heaven the realm of God the realmof the celestials the realm of the oneswho put seek in hell for rebellingagainst them in the first place seek maybe the ruler of this world but thatdoesn't mean he wants to be there thisis a punishment for him just likeeveryone else I believe he wants to goback to the celestial realm to face offagainst the celestials once again and weare the ones who are going to help himdo it we are the ones able to movebetween Realms and so by catching us andtaking over our bodies he can to beforenow we never really talked about seekmainly because outside of his cool Chasesequence in the hotel he didn't reallydo anything he felt like all style andno substance instead we all focused onthe figure as the main antagonistbecause he was the big bad we had to tryand stop in the hotel but now in theminds the figure is nothing more than abackground character we are being shownthat seek is the a real threat we needto worry about I mean what greaterthreat is there than the Devil Himselfright the one who was cast down by thecelestials now trying to return and weare his ticket out of here which meansit's even more important that we put astop to him once we get to Hell's Centerand don't worry this update took 2 yearsto come out so we have plenty of time toget good before that happens but heythat's just a theory a game theorythanks for watching if you want to keepgoing deeper down the Roblox horrorrabbit hole just walk through the dooron screen and watch our episode of dressto impress trust me it's scarier than itsoundscan flying vehicles actually exist I'mnot talking about helicopters or dronesor whatever this thing is I'm talkingabout the kind of thing we see in StarWars Outlaws something that looks andacts like a regular motorcycle justwithout those old-fashioned Wheels isthere actual science in this sciencefiction or does it just fall apart whenyou don't have the Magical Force bindingit together well de theorists we'reabout to findout hello Internet welcome to GameTheory the show that's only worriedabout one force gravity especially whenit comes to today's topic because thisepisode is sponsored by Ubisoft andtheir latest game Star Wars Outlaws madein collaboration with Lucas game StarWars Outlaws changes the typical StarWars formula in a great way instead offocusing on Jedi the force andlightsabers we get to see the other sideof the coin and live out our Han Solofantasies of being a galactic scoundrelas we take on the role of K vest setbetween The Empire Strikes Back andReturn of the Jedi the Empire are tryingdesperately to Snuff out the Rebellionwhich leaves small planets on the edgeof the Galaxy with very little oversightallowing the criminal underworld to riseup and take control Ubisoft actuallyinvited me and a bunch of other creatorsto La so we could get to see the gamefirsthand it was great to meet othercreators and compare notes with what weenjoyed about the game for some it wasthe complete open world whichsurprisingly is a first for the StarWars franchise for others it was thedynamic reputation system thatdramatically changes your gameplaydepending on who you side with and somejust really enjoyed getting to pet youradorable companion Nicks I may have beenone of them who's a good boy Who's thegoodest little alen that ferociouslyattacks the faces of my enemies you areyeah yeah you are however there was onepart of the game that everyone I spoketo agreed that they loved the speedabike nothing quite beats jumping on yourspeeda and whizzing off to explore themassive open world before you it reallymade me want to go home and take my ownMot cycle on an adventure but thenreality set in sure riding my bikedefinitely makes boring trips a littlemore exhilarating but it doesn't reallycompare to the coolness that isessentially a hover bike how can I feeltruly free when I'm always attached tothe ground which leaves the obviousquestion will hover Vehicles like thatever be possible people have been askingthis question since the 1950s and yetdecades have gone by and I'm still riingon groundbased Wheels like a Chum thatbeing said just because it hasn't hitthe mainstream doesn't mean scienceisn't making huge strides in this fieldall those kids that grew up watchingStar Wars are now out there making Techthat could turn these pieces of ScienceFiction into science fact so will itever be possible to have a Speeder Bikelike K prepare to jump to light speedtheorists because the answers are outthere we just need to find them readypunch it if we're going to get a hoverbike of our own I figured it wouldprobably be wise to take a look at whatscience or science the game actuallyuses to achieve this and fortunately Ihave had the chance to sit down with thedevelopers and ask them directly you gotto love a primary source they confirmedto me that much like other speeders inStar Wars K speeder uses technologyknown as Repulsor lift this Tech is usedall over the Star Wars Universe from podracers to assault vehicles even tochairs basically if it's floating it'sprobably using Repulsor lift but whatdoes that actually mean well there is anofficial book series that's designed toshow the inner workings of variousvehicles from Star Wars including repullift technology and it's calledincredible cross-sections according tothose books Repulsor lift technologyworks by pushing against gravity inorder to produce thrust which is prettyvague isn't that kind of just how thrustWorks in general but not to worrybecause there's one other book that goesinto a little bit more detail the YT1300 Millennium Falcon owners workshopmanual it states that Repulsor liftengines achieve this thrust by creatinga field of negative gravity which pushesagainst each planet only gravitationalfield that's all just a lot of fancywords that simply translate to one thinganti-gravity unfortunately for mychildhood dream of hovering off into thesunset anti-gravity doesn't actuallyexist and I don't mean that we've lookedaround the universe and just haven'tfigured it out yet I mean anti-gravitycannot exist it would literally breakthe rules of physics as we know it everyobject in the universe has mass andeverything that has mass also has agravitational Pole from the tiniestelectrons to super massive black holesso in order for something to be theopposite of that to have ananti-gravitational pull or would it bepush at that point either way to achievethat it would therefore need negativemass and that's just not possible unlikesome of the other forces in our universelike electricity or magnetism which canhave positive and negative values orNorth and South Poles gravity only haspositive values if you take two objectsand smos them together their massesalways add to each other they nevercancel out even stuff like antimatterwhich sounds like it should be thecomplete opposite of regular matter hasbeen proven to have regular mass andtherefore be affected by gravity likeeverything else so with Star Wars lawunderstandably leaning more into fictionthan science is there something thatdoes exist that could help get myhoverbike dreams off the ground now I'msure a lot of you out there are alreadylooking at your screens thinking Tom wealready have vehicles that hover they'reliterally called hovercraft and yesyou're right those are hovering Vehicleswe've even seen ones that are roughlythe size of a motorcycle but there's abig reason they don't fit the bill forour Speeder Bike hovercrafts work bysucking in air and sending it throughhigh powerered fans which in turnpressurizes the air and sends itdirectly underneath the vehicle thiscreates an air cushion that allows thehovercraft to well hover or at leastpartially in order to make sure that theair doesn't immediately expand outwardshovercrafts have what's called a skirtwhich keeps keeps the air pressurecontained and pointing down allowing itto keep you off the ground but take alook at K's Speeder bike or any speederbike for that matter we can see there'sno skirt on this thing which meansthere's no pressurized air cushion tohold it up and that means hovercraftsain't going to cut it plus I'm notreally sure anyone can look cool whileriding something like this now you don'tstrictly need a skirt to use fans orpropellers for flights companies likeaerox hover Surf and airwis technologieshave created flying motorcycle Stylevehic Les using incredibly powerfulPhantom propellers to create the liftthat keeps you off the ground but atthat point it feels more like you'reflying than levitating and while Kspeeda does clearly displace some amountof dust and debris the sand clowns thesethings create are extreme If This Wereour solution we would be the reason thatsand gets everywhere in this universeand I'm not sure Anakin would take tookindly to that but you see I got toinspect the bike close up at the Ubisoftevent and let me tell you the attentionto detail was so on point even thethrottle and switches worked which meansthat I can confirm there are no fansanywhere on this thing so we're safefrom Vader's wrath this time but withthat as a dead end I need to keeplooking fortunately there was one moredevice that I'd remembered from my manyyears on the internet and I was hopingthat it would provide the solution backin 2015 Lexus came out with a veryimpressive commercial for a new type ofTransportation a skateboard not exactlya new kind of technology and Def def notwhat you'd expect from a car company butit was for good reason it was unlikeanything we'd seen before it washovering that isn't CGI that is anactual working hoverboard that realpeople were able to ride and do trickson the secrets are super unique materialknown as a superconductor despite thename superconductors aren't trainemployees with superpowers instead theyare materials that when cooled down toan extremely low temperature theirelectrons are able to freely move aroundin such a way that the object is able toproduce an electromagnetic field and aswe can see from the commercial they aresuper powerful it even goes over thewater which is perfect for our speederbike in Star Wars Outlaws K canencounter experts that help her upgradeher Tech and one of those upgrades is ahydro Repulsor that allows her to rideover water however while this hoverboardlooks good on the surface once I took apeek under the hood all of my hoveringdreams quickly melted away superconductive materials like itri and be Icopper oxide only exhibit theirsuperconductive properties when they arecoed to a temperature of-180 C or minus 292 de fah maintainingthose low temperatures is going to besuper impractical on desert planets oryou know in the UK during the recentheat waves for the Lexus commercial theywere literally pouring in liquidnitrogen to keep it working because ifyou don't you'll find yourselvesgrounded once again and that's not eventhe biggest issue you may may havecaught it when I was explainingsuperconductors but they aren't somemagical material that just float onanything superconductors float becausethey produce a magnetic field and ifyou've ever played with magnets as a kidor as an adult don't judge me you'llknow that a magnetic field will onlyrepel if you have two magnets of thesame polarity meaning for the supercconductor's magnetic field to cause itto float there would have to be amagnetic field underneath it for it torepel against in the first place andthat is exactly what is happening inthis commercial according to the vergethe board must be written above a highlyengineered track that's carefullyembedded with magnets strong enough tohold the board and a rider Yep thiswhole skate park even the floorunderneath the water was covered withmagnets as soon as you leave thatmagnetic floor that board and ourspeeder is going to just drop out of thesky now according to the ultimate StarWars reference book planets likeTatooine have large amounts of metalores close to the surface and those oreshave strange magnetic properties so ifall other planets were the same then itmight be possible for superconductors tobe used for Speeders but it certainlyisn't going to help us on our planet andcall me crazy but I'm not exactly surewe could convince every world governmentto put a bunch of magnets underneathevery square foot of ground just so Icould feel cool while I ride my bike tothe store so if all existing science isgoing to fail me then we're going tohave to try something a little moretheoretical my favorite and in the worldof theoretical science there is somesomething that not only allows forlevitation but doesn't require theinstallation of other materials into theground and it is still completelyinvisible to the naked eye let meintroduce you all to the wonderful worldof acoustic levitation which is exactlywhat it sounds like yeah even I'mdisappointed in that one sorry basicallyacoustic levitation uses the power ofsound waves to make things float howexactly does that work well it's alittle complicated it would probablytake me hours to break it all down fullyhere's the simp implified version if youhave two speakers pointed at each otherand start blasting some high frequencysound waves something interestinghappens at certain points in between thetwo waves would amplify each othercreating parts of the wave that arestronger and other parts of the wavesthat cancel out the alternating patternsof strong and weak waves create theselittle shelves that are able to holdobjects in place and the cool part iseven if you put something inside thefield like your hand or a plant or rockthat you're driving over it doesn'tinterrupt the levitation field itcontinues floating it also works withliquids they stay in droplet form andcan be moved around and interact withother objects in the levitation fieldwhich is so cool to see and could beused for our waterf fairing speeder andif you're worried that these sound wavesare going to be unsuitable for sneakingaround hot outposts rest assured thatthe sound being used to make acousticlevitation possible is ultra Sonicmeaning it can't be heard by human earsas for whether it can be detected byJabba's ears not sure does he even haveears regular slugs can't hear anythingso I guess we're fine but you may havenoticed that much like we needed twomagnets for super conductors to work foracoustic levitation you need twospeakers to make it work or do youexperiments have been done as far backas the 9s to try and eliminate the needfor two speakers they used just onespeaker in directly at a 10 kg objectand blasted it with sound waves to makeit float and you know what it workedjust about it was only able to lift theobject a few hundred micrometers butstill like most science this is onlygoing to get better with time we'll beable to lift heavier and heavier thingshigher and higher off the ground all weneed to do is theoretically turn thesystem over blast sound waves at theground and because the ground ain'tmoving anywhere you'd find yourselfbeing lifted into the air so then why isthere still a decent chunk of the videoleft because while I think thistechnology is cool and I really wantedit to be the solution even on a theoreiCal level there are still issues Ican't Overlook yes acoustic levitationcould potentially raise your speed awhile on Solid ground but as soon as youmove over to the water you're going torun into some problems all that talkabout being able to levitate liquidswith sound yeah doesn't really work inReverse liquid is obviously not a solidit's literally another state of matterand so if you were to fire sound wavesat it it's going to get pushed outwardsmeaning your speeder has nothing to pushagainst and so you'll just keep sinkingand sinking until you end up at thebottom of the lake but even if youdecided to just ignore the hydroupgrades you're still not really in theclear remember when I said the speakersuse ultrasonic waves that frequency mayfall outside our normal range of hearingbut that doesn't mean it can't hurt therest of you ultrasonic frequency startat around 20 khz but people exposed tofrequencies above just 17 khz have beennoted to suffer from fatigue nauseaheadaches and dizziness long-termexposure like riding your motorcycle forhours as you explore the open world hasthe potential to cause even more damageto your biological tissues heating themup through vibrations leading to asevere case of death which I wouldDefine as a suboptimal result so despiteit being cool and definitely sci-fi asheck I once again had to go back to thedrawing board and honestly I was feelingpretty doubtful I was going to findsomething everything I tried everyscientific principle every theoreticalconcept nothing was able to completelysatisfy the criteria set out by StarWars Outlaws and much like K during thegame I was running out of options I wasready to H myself into the vacuum ofspace because at least then no one couldhear me scream as I drove myself insaneand that's when it hit me space I was sofocused on technology being used to makehovering Vehicles here on Earth Icompletely ignored the fact that we havepeople who work day in and day out todefy the laws of gravity NASA most ofthe time they use what you'd expect formodern rockets say get off the ground byessentially exploding large quantitiesof fuel and letting the force of thatexplosion lift the rocket into space butthat isn't the only kind of engine theyhave at their disposal they have beenworking on other methods of propulsionfor space travel and one of them solvesevery problem we've had it can keepthings off the ground and off the waterit doesn't blow sand everywhere and it'scompletely silent no fans no magnets notheoretical speakers plus to top it alloff it could plausibly fit into ourmotorcycl like design at least in a fewyears ladies and gentlemen I present toyou ion propulsion and it's so simpleI'm kind of annoyed I didn't think aboutit sooner ion engines work by firingions if the name wasn't a big giveawayions are particles that have either apositive or A negative charge mostcommonly these days they use an elementknown as Zenon and through the use ofpowerful electric currents these Zenonatoms lose their electrons formingpositively charged Zenon ions which isthen fired out of the back of theengines providing thrust NASA has beenusing these engines when they want toget satellites to very far distancesvery quickly in fact they've been usingion engines to explore the outer reachesof our Solar System since as early as1998 with the deep space one probe butit doesn't just work in space wherethere's no gravity either in 2021undefined Technologies created a fullyelectric hovering drone using youguessed it ion propulsion and as you cansee it works no big gusts of wind nonoise just thrust it also doesn't relyon having something solid beneath it topush against which means it can work onwater on land pretty much anywhere youcan think of it even solves problems Ihaven't mentioned about the speeder yetK speeder is able to make very short andsharp side to side movements to avoidenemy fire at a push of a button and oneof the other upgrades she gets allowsthe speeder to do a short jump directlyupwards with most of our options thesejust wouldn't be possible at least notwith the speed and precision that we seein the game but with iron propulsion wecan for dodging all you have to do ishave small ion thrusters in the correctspot and then have a button to activatethat thruster for a quick burst of sideto side movement and for the jump ionpropulsion works just like any otherThruster give it a little more juice byhaving a button that injects a couplemillion extra ions through the frusterand Bam you've gained some extra heightfor a short moment now I should probablysay that at this point in time the bestion engines we have are only able togenerate about one newton of force whichis a far cry from the 650 Newtons youneed to pick up a person let alone amotorcycle given how this kind ofTechnology tends to develop over timeit's only going to get better for hereand do you know who else believed inthat idea George Lucas himself becausethe funniest part of all of this is thation propulsion has been used forcountless vehicles in the Star WarsUniverse it just tends to be for thebigger space fairing ones rather thanthe smaller on planet ones TI fighterliterally stands for twin ion engines sowe don't even have to break the law forthis to be possible I mentioned thatNASA had been using ion thrusters toexplore deep space since 1998 but thefirst ever engine was actually tested in1964 so it would seem that George isjust like us he was literally puttingthe science into science fiction he useda technology that no didn't completelywork when it was first tested and itwouldn't be perfected or widely adoptedfor a good few years but he saw thepotential if you just gave it time andthat friends is what it truly means tobe a theorist all we need now is forNASA to stop trying to send people toMars and instead working on making ironpropelled hover bikes please I need itshut up and take my money but hey I justgot to say thank you one final time tothe sponsor of today's video Ubisoftit's been such a blast trying to makeall of this crazy sci-fi Tech fit intoour realistic World which feels fittingbecause Star Wars Outlaws is exactlythat while there's still plenty ofaliens laser blasters and space travelit feels really grounded I wasn't surehow I'd feel about a game with noMagical Force Powers but Ubisoft did anincredible job hooking me into that partof the universe different crimesyndicates you interact with throughoutthe game feel truly alive thanks toOutlaw's Dynamic reputation system everyaction you do or don't take changes howthey feel about you and locks you out ofcertain places while giving you accessto others and you can experience all ofthis for yourselves right now just headon down to the description and click thelink to download the game today andbegin your own journey through a galaxyfar far away the game is available onXbox series s and X PlayStation 5 and PCso whatever your preference ubisoft'sgot you covered and that's great becauseyou're probably going to be here a whilethis open world is huge like huge hugefull of side quests loot even a funsecret or two if you look hard enoughwhich I'm sure you theorists will findin no time so once again go and checkout the game by clicking the link in thedescription thanks again to Ubisoft forsponsoring this video and as alwaysfriends remember it's all just a theorya game theory thanks for watchingBarbie exists in poppy playtime and thatis horrifying in the orientationnotebook playtime code tells us that theorphans in playcare aren't allowed toplay with toys from other companiesspecifically calling out Barbie ifBarbie toys exist in this world thatalso implies that all of playtime Cotoys and their horrible experiments alsoexist in other universes we've seenBarbie toys in friends cheers TheBodyguard but the most disturbing onehas to be Toy Story we've never reallyunderstood how these toys come to lifefor now sadly we might have our answerit seems like play Co aren't the onlyones experimenting with living toysthese family-friendly movies areactually showing the tortured existenceof Orphans turned into toys for profitdon't you just love capitalism that'swhy all the toys want is to be playedwith just like poppy in the gang allthese orphans have ever known isloneliness now they get all that loveand attention while also stopping thesechildren from feeling alone like theydid though I'm not quite sure how forkyfits into this maybe they'll explain itin the poppy movie but who do you thinkis going to be the Oppenheimer to puppywhat's the point of this mask from intothe pits as you explore the house of ourmain character Oswald this item can fallfrom the attic but when during the gamethis happens is completely random what'seven stranger is that it's the onlypiece of Fazbear merchandise in theentire house the game would have youbelieve that it's just a tradeable itemand while yes you can use it for thatpurpose there are plenty of other itemsthat show up way more reliably that canalso be used for the game's one and onlytrade making a luck based item like thisfeel totally unnecessary unless it's notreally here to be a game mechanic it'shere to tell us something somethingimportant and I think I know what itis hello Internet welcome to Game Theorythe show that yes is finally talkingabout the biggest and only FNAF game of2024 into the pit a game based on thefirst Fazbear fright Story released aspart of the big finale of fnaf's 10thanniversary or at least it was supposedto be it ended up coming out a day earlyand so instead we got FNAF movie scriptpages on the final day Le shouldprobably look into that regardless itcame out and people loved this thinglike the original story we follow a10-year-old boy called Oswald who findsa time traveling bullpit inside hislocal pizzeria Jeff's Pizza the bullpittakes him back to 1985 where he findsout that Jeff's used to be a FreddyFazbear's this thing's got all the stuffyou'd expect arcade machines pizza and abunch of dead kids along with the yellowrabbit Mas got that's responsible yeahthis place is the real deal the yellowrabbit tries to catch Oswell but heescapes only for the yellow creature tojump out and drag his dad back into thepit instead the rabbit then reemergesfrom the pit only now he's posing asOswald's father and I don't just meanhe's acting like his dad I mean hephysically takes on his appearance atleast to everyone else nobody seems tobe able to see the yellow Rabbit Exceptfor Oswald and so it's up to him to finda way to sneak past the rabbit get outof the house and back to Jeff's to findhis dad eventually oswal does find himfrees him and kills the yellow rabbit inthe process there are some changes hereand there to make sure that it works asa game rather than a 40-page story butoverall it's a really good experiencethe time travel mechanics work great forin-game puzzles and the pixel art styleis gorgeous however like any FNAF gamewe all know why we're really here thelaw and that's where things get a littlebit messy this game is full of refrefences from all across the FNAFUniverse Fazbear fright Stories thegames the graphic novels the FNAF movieoh and then there's this WOW whoever GGYis has the top score on every game Imean technically if Gregory were a robothe would live this entire time whattrolls you are so yeah as you can seethe lore of this game is a bit all overthe place it's hard to know if these aremeant to be just Easter eggs or whetherthey're legitimate law and I'm sure wecould all argue about this till theanimatronic cows come home but instead Ifigured we'd do something a littledifferent rather than focusing onsolving the LW of this game specificallyI wanted to try zooming out a littleMatt mentioned in a previous theory thatthe original six games are about theafon family their lives their mistakestheir deaths their resurrections all ofthat stuff but since then we've begunbeing introduced to characters who atsome point or another were impacted bythe afon family and their actions Cassiein ruin her father in help wanted toothis new era of FNAF is about the Rippleeffects caused by the afon family and Ibelieve we're being shown exactly thatin into the pit and it all comes down toa single collectible the Freddy mask Yepthis one item is going to help us notonly understand the themes Scott ispresenting with modern FL but also showus where it might be going in the futurehow well let's just pop in the secondtape to find outa[Laughter][Music][Laughter]embrace your legacy the LegacyCollection featuring four new signaturejackets and a range of flatteringgraphic te's is available now at Luminofficial.comwelcome back from the break thanks forsticking with us before we get too deepinto the big meta stuff we shouldprobably go over the basics of thisFreddy mask during the game you canexplore multiple rooms in Oswald's houseone of the rooms is Oswald's attic buton a random night there's a chance thatthis Freddy mask will fall down when youopen the hatch this stood out as astrange detail because one it's notmentioned in the original book but twoOswell doesn't really know who Freddy isif you collect the toy Freddy item hecalls Freddy this thing rather than byhis name and then if you collect thismask specifically he asks why wouldanyone want to look like this thing notonly does he not know who Freddy is buthe has no idea why anyone would want tolook like him this cannot be his maskmeaning it would have to belong tosomeone else in the house given theirprominent in the game my first thoughtwas that it must belong to his dad butwhen I realized that there was just onethought running through my head isOswald's dad Freddy bro the bullywearing the Freddy mask during the biteof 83 I definitely wasn't the onlyperson thinking this either plenty ofothers online were quick to make thisconnection but why why would theimmediate assumption be that if Oswald'sdad has a Freddy mask then he must bethis random character from FNAF 4 wellbecause this isn't the first time thishas happened in ruin Cassie was able tocollect a Bonnie mask and combining thatwith other details she gave us about herdad like the fact his favorite characterwas Bonnie and that he collected Fazbearmemorabilia from the80s it led us tobelieve that Cassie's dad was anotherone of these bullies Bonny bro howeveruh mask alone does not a Freddy bro makethere would obviously need to be otherconnections and so the first question Iasked myself was does the timeline matchup it sounds simple enough but we'reactually missing a number of crucialdetails the game doesn't tell us how oldosw dad is all we know is that he's oldenough to have a 10-year-old son on theother side of things while we don't havethe exact ages it seems pretty widelyaccepted that Michael and his bullyfriends are at least twins when we seethem in 1983 so for Freddy bro andoswal's dad to be the same person in thepit would need to take place far enoughin the future from 1983 where he couldgrow up have a kid and have the kid turn10 years old while also not being so farinto the future that he becomes toounreasonably old to look the way he doeswhich leads me to my second problem thegame is very explicit that Oswald istraveling back to 1985 but it's neverstated what year he starts in in factMega cat Studios has been so careful notto reveal the date that despite thecalendar in the past giving us the monthand year the one in oswal's house duringthe present only shows the month butthere are a few details that slippedthrough the cracks and I believe thatthey can help us figure out at least arough range of dates for when this storytakes place during the second day youhave have the opportunity to look aroundOswald's school and in the secondclassroom you can find several thingshanging on the wall like numbers asunclock and a world map that seems alittle broken maybe that's why there'sno bears in security breach before theirExtinction bears were known to attackpizza delivery trucks probably a theoryfor another day but just below that veryconfusing map is the actually importantdetail another calendar just like theone in our house it tells us the monthwith no year but there's one crucialdifference it has the days crossed outwith the final marked date on thecalendar being August 16th now as a BritI typically read my calendars as thefirst day being a Monday and the lastday being a Sunday that would makeAugust 16th a Friday in this gamehowever FNAF takes place in the US andyou guys use some weird calendars thatstart on a Sunday and end on a SaturdayI have no idea how this makes sense toyou it's called the week end for areason anyway using this calendar systemmeans that August 16th is a Thursdayduring the year the game takes placethere's only a few years after 1985where August 16th has been on a Thursday1990 2001 2007 2012 and 2018 thisimmediately Narrows down our search butthe range of dates still feels a littletoo large we're currently spanning threewhole decades plus if the game tookplace sometime during those early dateslike 1990 it would be nearly impossiblefor Oswald's Dad to have a 10-year-oldson and be a tweenage Freddy bro in 1983so the search continues my guut instinctwas to look more closely at thetechnology being used techs come a longway in the last 30 years so it should bepretty easy to date the piece of tech wehave the most Hands-On time with in thisgame is Oswald's Dad's cell phone takinga look at it in your inventory there's acomment from oswal about how it's quotethe saddest most out-of-date modelimaginable and by today's standards yeahI definitely agree so I did someresearch into older mobile phones andafter looking through multiple siteswith every remen model of phone sincethe 1980s I found this the Nokia 6600which is almost identical to the phoneoswal uses throughout the game thisphone was released in 2003 which meansour most problematic timeline years of1990 and 2001 are off the board as forthe other dates I had to do a lot moredigging than I anticipated Scott andmega cat did a very good job keeping theworld looking pretty ambiguous I lookedat washing machines water fountainsblackboards whiteboards TVs but all ofthem were either too generic to suggesta year or the item is still being usedin the modern day despite its agethankfully my technology hunch camethrough once again because during thegame's final day you get to go into theback of Jeff's Pizza and there you canfind Jeff sitting down at his computertaking a look at the screen Iimmediately noticed something the graytaskbar and Window Design is identicalto the design of Windows 95 but actuallythat isn't what I noticed despite comingout in 199 5 people do still run Windows95 today no what I noticed was the sizeof his monitors specifically theiraspect ratio aspect ratio basicallyrefers to the ratio between the heightand the width of an object or video forexample the video you're watching rightnow has an aspect ratio of 16x 9 meaningfor every 9 pixels of height There are16 pixels of width most Standard TVshows and YouTube videos are made inthis format so naturally most of our TVsand computer monitors are built to matchthat but that wasn't always the casecomputer screens actually used to comein two different aspect ratios 4x3 or 16by10 that was until 2008 when the modern16x9 was introduced and in 2010 theytook over the market as the majority sothe question is what size are Jeff'smonitors of course I whipped out thetrusty pixel measurements and I canconfirm that Jeff's monitors are in factmodern 16x9 monitors despite him stillrunning Windows 95 not sure you're goingto be getting the most out of thosemonitors I'm sure LT would have somethoughts but hey you do you that knocks2007 out of the running leaving us with2012 and 2018 which for our purposes isactually more than enough the fact thegame can't take place in any of theyears prior to 2012 means that from atimeline standpoint it's definitelypossible for Oswald's dad and Freddy broto be the same person if he was ateenager in the 80s by 2010s nearly 30years have passed so he'd definitely beold enough to have a kid of his ownhowever even with with that part of thetimeline at least somewhat figured out Irealized I had a different problem sureoswal's Dad could be the right age if hewas a teenager in 1983 but that kind ofrelies on us Assuming he's Freddy bro tobegin with which isn't proof in and ofitself I needed more I didn't just needthe year of the game I needed somethingthat proved oswal's dad was alive inthe80s I looked through every inch ofthis game but found nothing so I did theonly thing I could I went back andreread the book I know who could haveseen that coming now I've read thesebooks countless times but each time I donew details jump out to me and with thisnew game fresh in my mind I spotted thisquote Dad how old were you in 1985 I wasjust a couple years older than you all Icould think about was how many quartersI had to spend at the arcade Jeff'sPizza back before it was Jeff's Pizza itwas some kind of arcade wasn't it yeahit was but it closed at this point weknow that Jeff's Pizza was originally aFreddy Fazbear's Pizza back in 19 1985so for Scott to remind us of that aswell as tell us that Oswald's dad spentall of his time in arcades like itduring 1985 it's not a massive leap toassume that the two are connected so Notonly was Oswald's dad alive during 1985but he spent a lot of time at Freddy'sas well but it gets better because eventhough Oswald's dad was playing koiabout his age a couple of years isdefinitely something we can work withfun fact there have actually beenstudies on what people mean when theysay a couple of years traditionally theword couple just meant two but now itcan basically mean anything from 2 toeight although it tends to average outat around 3 to 4 years if that's thecase then with Oswald being 10 duringthe story Oswald's dad would have beenroughly 13 to 14 during 1985 making himat least 40 for the earliest date wefound 2012 that is more than reasonableconsidering he has a 10-year-old son butdoes that line up with the FNAF forbullies well if Oswald's dad was 13 or14 in 1985 that would mean that in 19832 years earlier he would have been 11 or12 now we don't know the ages of Michaeland his friends here but we can make apretty good Educated Guess the averageheight of an 11 to 12 year old boy isbetween 56 and 59 in and during thescene we see them walk past a handful ofdining tables which usually measure inat around 30 in tall if you take a lookyou'll see that the bullies are just shyof double the table's height puttingtheir height smack dab in the middle ofthe 56 to 59 average did did we justfind the ages of the FNAF 4 B huh thatwas not the intention of this episodeand you know it's FNAF so I'm not goingto hold on to it too tightly but it'sdefinitely interesting to think aboutand for our purposes today it does meanthat Oswald's dad would have been theperfect age in 1983 combining that withhis frequenting of Freddy's locationsand owning the same mask he's lookinglike a pretty good good candidate forthe identity of the Freddy bro it's morethan just the timeline stuff too adetail I always thought was odd wasOswald's affinity for drawing quoteMechanical Animals he does this at thestart of both the game and the book andas we get more details it turns out he'sdrawing characters like Freddy Bonnieand Chica but this is before he's evengone to Freddy's and as I've alreadymentioned at that point Oswell doesn'tknow who these characters are what'seven weirder is these drawings don'tplay any part in the story whatsoever sowhy are we being this because the startof a story is where you establish whoyour character is their likes dislikeshopes dreams and their relationships inthis case we're being shown that beforethis story about AF Freddy Fazbear'seven starts this character this familyhas a connection to the Fazbearfranchise a connection Oswald may notfully understand but one that his dadcertainly does but why does this matterwhat does this fundamentally change forus and our understanding of thisfranchise well it's once again showingus that this modern era of FNAF iswidening our view on the world and thecharacters we look at focusing on theknock-on effects of the afon family andhow the part these other charactersplayed all led to them changing theirways cass's dad being Bonny bro in ruinwas the first instance of this Cassietells us that he had a technician's Fazwrench hinting that after the bite of 83he grew up and became a technician sothat he could stop any malfunction likethe one he witnessed from ever happeningagain Oswald's dad being Freddy bro doesthe same thing we love learned thatOswald's dad used to work at the localMill before it shut down again in trueScott fashion he kept what type of Millthis was vague in the story I alwaysimagined it was just your typical steelor wood mill but in the game we actuallyget to visit this Mill or moreaccurately you get to visit the trashsheep outside the mill although thisisn't any ordinary trash I mean some ofit is but next to the classic black bagsyou can see a few recognizable Fazbearcharacters the most obvious ones aretrash in the gang from FNAF 6 because ofcourse the characters made from literaltrash are hiding out in a dumpster butbesides them you can also find thingslike a toy Bunny Doll a bunny mask aFreddy head and a couple of animatronichands and feet and these things dobelong to the mill as well becauseOswald says that they've been sittingthere ever since the Factory closed downthis Mill isn't just your typical Millthey were making parts for Fazbearentertainment Oswald's dad worked atthis Factory so it seems like he grew upand started working at the local Factorythat made Fazbear Park to make sure thatthey were properly inspected tested andapproved before being sent out that wayno kid would ever suffer the same fateas Michael's brother due to a faultypart four years Michael the foxy bro wasthe only one of the bullies to truly tryto atone for the mistake he made hewasn't able to help his brother but hetried to put his sister back togetherand when he learned the truth about hisdad from her he went on a mission tofinish him as well but for almost adecade the other three bullies basicallygot away with it they just disappearedinto the back of people's minds never tobe seen or heard from again now herethey are showing up one by one andrevealing to us that these events didchange them that just like Michael theytoo are trying to atone for what theydid back in1983 and this Theory Works regardless ofwhether you think into the pit and thebooks are 100% Cannon and Oswald's dadis literally Freddy bro or whether youbelieve he's just a parallel for agrown-up Freddy bro the theme is stillthe same this era of FNAF is about theRipple effects of the aftons and theatonement of the FNAF for bullies Scottis trying to wrap up loose ends thatwere left dangling for years he's givingus a little more insight into charactersthat up until now have basically beenone-dimensional both Bonnie bro andFreddy bro were just bullies mean kidsthat thought it would be funny to shoveMike's little brother into the mouth ofan animatronic he was terrified of butnow we're being shown that they didn'tstay those One Note cruel bullies afterthat that just like Michael they werehaunted by what they did and were doingwhatever they could to make up for it wesee during the end of the game thatOswald's dad deeply cares about his sonhe's no longer the awful bully he's kindand loving just wanting to provide forhis family and before the factory shutdown he was trying to stop the samehorrifying incident happening again justlike Bonny bro did as a technician andjust like Foxy bro did when he put anend to dear old dad so theorists whenthe next Naf game does come out one thatisn't a prequel anyway make sure youkeep an eye out for a chica

PeachMinecraft's new weapon is completely broken.Not only can the mace literally one-shot any mob in the game,but it can also negate any and all fall damage.For most players, this sounds like the perfect weapon.But for me, it sounds a little too good to be true.And you know what that means!It's time for us to bust out those calculators and crunch the numbers to find out.Is the mace truly OP levels of broken,or will the only thing that's broken by the end of this be Steve?Hello, Internet!Welcome to Game Theory, the show that's always got an ace up its sleeve.Or, should I say, mace.Because in a recent update, Mojang released what might be the single most powerful,most unique, and all-around coolest weapon ever.The mace.At first glance, it doesn't seem too impressive.It only does the same amount of damage as an iron sword.But the mace's true power lies in the new feature known as the smash attack.Hmm, wonder where Steve got that name from.By jumping from a large height and hitting an enemy as you fall,you can do massive amounts of damage.And the further you fall, the more damage your smash attack does.Plus, according to Mojang, there is no cap on the damage you can do.But what's more impressive than that is that if you do hit your target,all of the fall damage you would have received is completely negated.That's right, zero fall damage.This is what makes the mace the ultimate high-risk, high-reward weapon.But how is a simple mace able to do all of that?Well, it's not really clear.There's no explanation in the game, as usual.And Mojang has been weirdly cagey about it.Ugh, indeed.I guess that means, yet again,it's our job here at Game Theory to answer the question the developers can't.Could you actually do all of that damage and still survive the fall?Would a skilled player wielding this mace be a one-man god-slaying machine,or will that unsuspecting mob be the last thing that Steve sees before his demise?There's only one way to find out.Get your breeze rods ready, loyal theorists,because we are using science to jump off of the mountain that is Minecraft's mace.Let's just hope it's more of a superhero landing and less of a faceplant.Obviously, the main thing that makes the mace so unbelievably powerfulis the fact it can negate all fall damage if used correctly.But if we want to figure out just how or if that's all possible,we need to understand how the mace gets its power in the first place.If you've ever dropped something like your phone from a high place,you may be intimately aware of the potential damage that can be done.That's because if you're holding something high above the ground,while it may not be moving,it still contains a specific type of energy.Potential energy.Energy that is just waiting to be released.If I then let go of that object,that potential energy is released as it starts falling towards Earth,converting into kinetic energy, or energy of movement.By the time that object hits the ground,all of that potential energy has been completely converted into kinetic energy,which leaves you with a cracked screen or a bump on your noggin if you get in the way.The higher off the ground an object is when you release it,the more potential energy it has,and therefore, the more kinetic energy it has when it hits the ground.So, on that front, it does seem like Mojang were paying attention in high school physics.The higher Steve's height is when he jumps,the more energy and destructive power the mace is going to have.But how much power is it exactly?According to the Minecraft Wiki, the mace's base damage is 6,and the damage ramps up the higher you fall from.You can one-shot a player wearing full Protection 4 netherite armor from 30 blocks high,and if you jump from around 314 blocks high,you can deal enough damage to one-hit KO the game's strongest mob, the Warden.But that's all in-game damage.I want to know how much damage the mace would actually do.And for that, we're going to need to turn to an old favourite, FMA.Not the famous anime, although that is one of my personal favourites.I'm talking about our favourite equation, force equals mass times acceleration.Let's start with figuring out the acceleration, as that's actually pretty easy to calculate.You may already know that on Earth, every object, be it a bowling ball, a feather, or a human,has the same acceleration due to gravity of 9.8 meters per second squared.Unfortunately, that's not how it works in Minecraft.In the game, not every object experiences the same acceleration due to gravity.Instead, different entities experience different accelerations.For players and mobs specifically, they experience an acceleration of 0.08 blocks per tick squared.Unfortunately, what we do know is that 1 block equals 1 meter, and 20 ticks equals 1 second.So, after doing some quick conversions, Steve's acceleration due to gravity winds up being 32 meters per second squared,which is over 3 times the acceleration we feel here on Earth.He is taking falling like a rock to a whole new level.But regardless, we have our acceleration.Now we just need to figure out his mass, which is a little more complicated.Steve doesn't actually have a canon weight or mass.However, he does have a canon height.And thanks to Steve's blocky shape, it means we can actually figure out his mass by first figuring out his volume.And to do that, we need to use my second favorite formula, density equals mass over volume.If only I had some kind of relaxing lo-fi to help me concentrate while I do all these equations.Oh wait, I do!Lo-fi!If you thought Minecraft's music was chill, just wait till you listen to this.Mmm, yes, very demure, very mindful. I jest, but Matt, Dan, and the team have worked so hard to make this an awesome listening experience for you guys.They've also managed to sneak in a fun murder mystery with deep lore, because of course they have.If you head on over to the YouTube channel, you can follow our hero, Taylor,as she accidentally finds herself trapped in the middle of this whole mystery.We actually just dropped episode 2, and let me tell you, it is full of juicy lore for you guys to decipher.It is full of juicy lore for you guys to decipher.So you'll definitely want to go and check that out.Some theorists have already found a fair bit, but trust me, there is a lot more to find.Plus, we're releasing new tracks every Monday over on Spotify,and in true theorist fashion, there are even secrets hiding inside the music too.So if you want to be the first to solve the new lore when it drops,or if you just want to listen to some of the chillest beats on the internet,grab your mace and smash the link in the description.Speaking of mace, now that we've got the soundtrack to our complex math sorted,let's get back to figuring out the mace's damage using Steve's volume.First, we need his canon height.According to Mojang and their parent company, Microsoft,Steve is canonically 6'2", or 1.875m tall.And if you take a look at Steve's model real closely, you will notice that he's made up of pixels.Specifically, Steve is 32 pixels tall.So, 32 pixels equals 1.875m, making the side of each pixel 5.86cm, or 2.31 inches.From here, we can calculate the volume of each pixel simply by multiplying the pixel's length by its width and by its height.And given they're all the same, that equates to each pixel having a volume of 201.23cm.All I need to do now is figure out how many of these pixel cubes Steve is made out of to get his total volume.So, after a lot of counting, I can tell you that Steve is made out of 1,664 pixels,which gives him a total volume of 334,846.72cm.All that's left to do now is to find his density.Humans typically have a density of around 0.985gcm,so we can just plug that and our volume into the formula and,wham-bam-bibbidi-bow, we've got ourselves our mass.Which comes out to a grand total of 329.8kg, or just over 727lbs.For reference, the average male in the US is around 90kg, or 200lbs,which is less than a third of what Steve weighs.I guess, much like Minecraft's cakes, Steve is just one thick, blocky boy.Respectfully, of course.But, finally, we can go back to our original FMA formula.We have our A, and now we have our M.So, we plug those in, and with that, I can reveal that the force of a falling Steve is...DRUM ROLL PLEASE!Oh, is Yosi still out? Huh, kind of expecting him to fill this in.Uh, editor, do you mind doing it? Thank you.The answer is a whopping 10,553.6N.According to research done by Japanese scientists, it takes just 5,400N to not just crack,but straight up smash a human skull.A la the mountain from Game of Thrones.Steve is delivering almost twice that amount of force.Whatever mob or griefer Steve decides to target, it is going to be completely obliterated.But, if you think Steve is just gonna be walking away from this experience, think again.With a successful smash attack, Steve immediately stops his fall.And, while in the game, that seems to mitigate fall damage, that's not how physics works.As the old adage goes, it's not the fall that kills you, it's the sudden stop.Once you hit the ground after a fall, while you might feel like you stop almost instantly,your organs, not so much.They continue to stay in motion after the initial impact.For a slow enough fall, it's no big deal.But, if you slow down too abruptly, all of your squishy bits inside of you want to keep moving.Leading to tears, bruises, and in extreme cases, permanent damage or even death.So, it's less about how he's stopping, and more about the fact he's stopping at all.Even if he hits an enemy, Steve is still slowing down extremely quickly.And that acceleration, or more accurately, deceleration, is what's going to cause him a problem.When we talked about acceleration earlier, we were talking about the acceleration thatall objects experience from being in Earth's gravity.But, on a more mathematical level, acceleration is about how much of an object's speed orvelocity changes over time.If I drop a bowling ball from a height, it'll experience acceleration equal to 9.8 metersper second per second.So, that means that after one second, the ball has gone from 0 to 9.8 meters per second.After another second, the ball will go from 9.8 to 19.6 meters per second, and so on and so forth.Acceleration is just the change in velocity divided by the change in time.That's why units of acceleration are given in meters per second per second.And you can find out how fast an object accelerates, or in our case, decelerates, by simply knowingthe change in velocity and the time it took to make that change.So, to test this, I fired up Minecraft for myself and had Steve perform some smash attacksfrom a height of 30 blocks, or 30 meters, the height it takes to kill a fully deckedout netherite player.After running my test several times, I found that Steve's velocity when he landed hisattack was around 32.13 meters per second.I also noted that on average, it took Steve just five-sixths of a second to go from topspeed to zero.So, using our new formula for acceleration, I was able to calculate that Steve's accelerationwas 38.55 meters per second per second.We can now put that new acceleration back into our FMA formula, along with Steve'spreviously calculated thick boy mass.And from there, we can see that the force Steve feels from being decelerated that quicklyis...Second drum roll, please!Look, I know I've already asked for one.I know Yosi's out and he normally deals with this.C'mon, just do it for me, c'mon.The answer is 12,714 newtons.The human spine can only manage around 3,000 newtons before it shatters, and the femur,one of the strongest bones in the human body, can break at just 4,000.So, yeah, Steve's not looking so hot after this.And it's only gonna get worse the higher he goes.If Steve falls from a height of 314 meters, enough to one-shot the warden, then the forcethat will be tingling through his body is an absolutely inconceivable 28,304 newtons.Now that's a lot of damage!Okay, so from those heights, Steve's gonna be flatter than a British pancake.But that does beg the question, what height could he fall from and survive?That turned out to be a much harder question to answer than I originally thought.You see, humans, we're weird sometimes.Some people can die from a fall as little as a few feet, while others have been knownto fall from literal aeroplanes and live to tell the tale.Obviously, the range of a few feet to a few miles is a bit too big of a range to be veryhelpful to us.However, there has been rigorous scientific research into the average height of a fatalfall.One study from the World Journal of Emergency Medicine analysed over 460 patients who wereadmitted to hospital for a fall, in order to figure out the odds of surviving as theheight of the fall increases.They discovered that at around 12 metres or 40 feet, patients had a 50-50 chance of surviving.For an average person, falling from a height of 12 metres will mean travelling at 15.34metres per second when they make contact with the ground.Using FMA once again, we can calculate the force that a normal person experiences whenlanding that 50% fall, and it ends up being just 4,755 newtons.But, remember, Steve is quite a bit heavier than your average person, and the gravityin the Minecraft world is way stronger.From 30 blocks, he was experiencing over 12,000 newtons of force.For him to hit that 50-50 chance of survival at just 4,755 newtons, he would only be ableto jump from a height of 7 blocks.Only the height of a two-storey house.High enough to be scary, sure, but not exactly high enough to feel like death is a fair outcome.Plus, at that height, his smash attack wouldn't even be doing enough to kill an Enderman.That amount of force is enough to kill someone 50% of the time, so if Steve wants to improvehis odds, he's gonna have to go even lower than that, making the mace less and less effective.Especially when you consider that by the time you're even able to get the mace, you haveplenty of other effective and safer tools at your disposal.You have enchanted diamond swords, plenty of armour, or you can just do it the old-fashionedway and drop an anvil on them from the same height.But when you can't even kill an Enderman without risking your life to a coin flip,this high-risk, high-reward weapon is more like high-risk, no reward.But you know what?If Steve is gonna lose it all as soon as he uses this weapon, he might as well go outwith a bang.Maybe someone, oh I don't know, stole his diamond and now he wants revenge no matterthe cost.So if Steve did decide screw it, forget surviving, just how much damage could I do with thisthing?What would that be?At first it seems kind of impossible, considering there is a limit to how fast Steve can fall.Steve's top falling speed, or terminal velocity, is 78.4 metres per second.He cannot fall faster than that, and that would actually cap him out at about 31,000Newtons.That's pretty darn strong, but it's only a few thousand more Newtons from what we calculatedfor his Warden killing jump.And I think we can go bigger.The game does say there's no limit to the amount of damage he can do after all.So let's kick terminal velocity to the curb and keep climbing.And you know what?We might as well get rid of the height limits while we're at it.So with no more limits and a few more calculations, I discovered that if Steve was willing toclimb a mere 6,000 blocks, about two thirds the height of Mount Everest, after he jumpedhe'd be hitting the ground with the same amount of energy as the atomic bomb droppedon Hiroshima.That is going to destroy literally everything within a 600 by 600 block radius.Enough to destroy pretty much any mega build that Diamond Thief could make.That'll certainly send a message.But you know what?Even that didn't feel like it was enough.I wanted to keep going.I wanted to take this to its absolute limit so that I, I mean Steve, never had to lookat anything that thief ever touched ever again.What would it take to destroy the entire planet?According to research, the energy required to destroy the earth is a mind boggling 2.25times 10 to the power 32 joules.Now we've done enough math in this episode, so I won't bore you with all the conversions.But what I will tell you is that for Steve to destroy the entire planet, he would needto jump from a height of third and final drum roll, please.Yes, I know.I know I've done it three times.Yes, I know I'm overdoing it a little bit.Please, just one more.I'm not going to do it again.Please.Thank you.The answer is a small 2.253 trillion light years.That's 22.5 million times the length of our Milky Way galaxy, 163 times the length ofthe observable universe.That would take a long time, but oh, would it be so worth it just to see the look onhis face when I come crashing down and destroy everything he holds dear.That's what you get for stealing my diamonds.I may have some pent up aggression I need to work through.Can we bring the lo-fi back?So calming.But there you have it, theorists.The mace really is the most broken weapon we've ever seen in Minecraft.Just not in the way Mojang intended.At the right height, you can literally destroy anything, or anyone, you can imagine.But it comes at a cost.Due to the force he's experiencing when stopping, even from a very small height, thatepic superhero landing might just be the last thing poor old Steve ever does.At least until he respawns.But hey, that's just a theory.A game theory.Thanks for watching, and if you want to

killed specifically by Baba Yagaherself well grab your carving knivestheorist because we've got a whole newmansion to explore and it is full ofcryptic messages Slavic folklore and abrand new cast of victim I meancharacters to woo over and they're allgoing to come together to help us findthe truth I just hope you like the tasteof meat we start this game once again asthe Baba Yaga along with potato whoduring the true ending of cookingcompanions DLC convinced us to gooutside but not to touch grass insteadwe are to eat everyone we find we readthe same note from that ending about aman named Ivan and swear revenge on theperson who sent it to us right beforepassing out suddenly we wake up in a newlocation but something is different ourway of speaking has changed and I don'tjust mean the dialogue the actual textboxes and menus have changed visualstyle clearly we are now playing as adifferent character someone separatefrom the Baba Yaga whose textbox stylewas identical to what we saw in thefirst game this new character wakes upin a mansion surrounded by a new groupof romanceable characters each one moreintriguing than the last first is Kurtour youthful rich and mysterious hostthere's ranata Kurt's financial advisorthere's Dimitri a young Doctor Whoapparently can clean up blood real goodand last but certainly not least isKurt's bodyguard and Resident musclemommy jazella I'm telling you she tookone look at buffsuki and said hashtaggoals it's at this point that both ofour worlds begin to collide Bara Yagareaches the Mansion determined to endKurt's life and she is actually a lotmore pleasant to look at than I wasexpecting were you expecting somethingelse little old me guys is it hot inhere or is it just the old sauner I'mrecording in right now as the night goeson Baba Yaga slowly kills members of ourcrew we are attacked by their ghosts andwe have to figure out who to trust BabaYaga Kurt or the new adorable Spiritsfollowing us around a duck named Max anda rabbit named Clover by speaking to allof our new Companions and by doing thecooking companion staple of clickingeverything over and over again we beginto realize what's really been going onat the Mansion Kurt has been doingexperiments on the mansion's inhabitantsin including us wiping all of ourmemories in order to stop anyone turninghim into the authorities and of coursethe game ends with multiple differentendings that range from doing just thatturning her in to burning the Mansiondown to the ground to once again fallingin love with the Baba Yaga I neverreally understood that from the firstgame with her being described as an oldhag but now that I've seen her formyself yeah I get it anyway that's themain story of dread weight or at leastthe surface level one but as we all knowthere is way more that meets the eyewith these games there's a lot of secretlaw hiding in this thing so much so thatI'm likely not going to get to covereverything in this video so if there areMysteries I don't get around to solvingtoday let me know down in the commentsor if you just really like this seriesand want more episodes on it leave acomment as well that works too but let'sactually start solving at least some ofthe game's Secrets starting with thesame ones we did when we covered cookingcompanions where are we when are we andwho are we so let's start with theeasiest one the we the Bara Yaga startsthe game in zako pane but after a lessthan ideal interaction with a local wemove on and when we ask potato where weare he says Northwest of the cabinhelpful as always potato that could meananywhere from the most Northwestern partof Slovakia to Poland or even Denmarkdepending on how far we' traveledfortunately our other main characterseems to be able to get a little moreinformation Kurt mentions almostimmediately that we took a boat ride toget to the mansion and that it's locatedon an island jaella also mentionsthrowing someone's remains into theBaltic Sea so surpris inly I wasn't toofar off with Denmark although there area number of island in the Baltic Seathat would be considered Northwest ofthe tarris mountains so let's get alittle more specific going back to ourtrusty Slavic folklore there is anisland that appears in a number ofSlavic folktales the island of buan thisisland has the ability to appear anddisappear with the tide which is prettyuseful for a guy who's trying to avoidthe authorities but some Scholars haveclaimed that buan isn't a mythologicalplace but the Slavic name for a a realIsland an island known as rugan which islocated in the Baltic Sea just off thecoast of Northeast Germany which wouldbe Northwest of the tartous mountainsnear the final moments of the game wesee Kurt being interrogated as he pullsup to a port when asked where he'scoming from he avoids the questioninstead responding visiting some friendsin straand straand is the mostnortheastern part of Germany and is theclosest port to the island of rugan infact there's now actually a giant Bridgeconnecting the two so clearly thisMansion is located on the island ofrugan and that means we're playing quitea way out from where the game firststarted zakopane to rugan is about 830km or 516 Mi that would take a normalperson around 8 days nonstop on foot nowonder the baraba Yaga was passing outall the time on the way over I find ithard just walking 10 ft to the cupboardto grab more M&M so that's are where nowthe question is when we figured out thatthe first game took place in the 1930and for the true ending of the game theBaba Yaga left the cabin to terrorizelocal towns like zakopane at the verystart of this sequel the baraba Yagagets shot by a man in zakopane that mustmean that the game is following upalmost immediately right wrong just likewe've traveled much further than you'dexpect this game takes place a littlefurther in the future as you explore theMansion you can find letters hidden invarious drawers just like you could inthe first game however in cookingcompanions these letters tended to befictional letters that gave us loreabout the fictional characters but inRedway that's not entirely the case someof them are real letters and sent byvery important people people likePresident Eisen Hower and Joseph Stalinand these letters are all on publicrecord which means we can use them tofigure out when this game takes placetwo of these letters come from Nikitakusov the first Secretary of theCommunist Party of the Soviet Union andthey're addressed to President John FKennedy one about the Cuban MissileCrisis and one about the state ofRussian and US relations both of whichwere sent in1962 this game is taking place threedecades after cooking companions that isa long time to hold a grudge Baba Yagaalthough I suppose when you're animmortal witch what a few decades all ofthat being said while these letters area good starting point there was oneother detail that pushes the date back alittle further if you choose to spendtime with Dimitri there's a chance he'lldrop this little piece of informationglad we're prioritizing economicstability instead of warfare like theAmericans colonizing Vietwhat a joke Americans colonizing Vietnamgiven we just found letters from the1960s he can only be talking about onething the Vietnam War the US put troopson the ground in Vietnam in 1965 andthey remained there until 1973 so forDimitri to be talking about thisinvasion in the present tense the war isstill going on and so we are playingsome time within those 8 years I knowit's not the most exact date I'll admitbut given this game takes place inGermany it does Place US during a reallycrucial time in German history afterWorld War II in 1949 Germany split intotwo independent nations the FederalRepublic of Germany in the west whoaligned with the Western democracieslike the US and the German DemocraticRepublic in the East who sided with theSoviet Union due to these differentideologies tensions were high to say theleast and the countries remained divideduntil 1990 putting this game smack dabin the middle of those historicaltensions during this time East Germanyhad a state Security Service known asthe stazzi and it was an Open Secretthat they were tapping phones andreading mail to try and catch Westonsympathizers and guess what we hear fromDimitri when we ask him about themansion's phone it's the only phone inthe Mansion Kurt needs it to make callsbesides it's bugged isn't the mailmonitored too and when you ask whobugged the phone Dimitri responds don'tplay dumb you know they're listeningit's a perfect match the time period thelocation the suspicion it all points tothe east German government being theones who tapped Kurt's phone they arethe ones he is actively trying to avoidwhich surprisingly leads directly intothe question about who we are in all ofthis I've already mentioned that nearthe end of the game Kurt is interrogatedon the docks of straand however he's notbeing interrogated by just anybody he'sbeing interrogated by us as theconversation goes on the interrogator isknocked out and dragged onto the boatexactly like we're told about when wefirst wake up at the start of the gamewe are the ones interrogating kurtt atthe dock making us what was known as agrenzer basically a border control agentexcept it goes a little deeper than thatgrenzers were mainly responsible for onething shooting anyone who tried toescape across the border but ourcharacter is doing a little more thanthat they're running a full-blowninvestigation in one interaction withKurt he confesses to having someonesteal a horse from Baba Yaga to which werespond stealing horses is a crime Kurtinstructing someone to commit a crime isalso a crime I bet your folders is akilometer high and Kurt replies what areare you remembering Kurt reactsspecifically to us mentioning his folderas in his case file for us to remember acase File means we aren't just a normalborder control agent we are more likelypart of the gdr secret police the stazzythat's why we know about the mail beingmonitored why Dimitri tells us not toplay dumb when we ask who bugged thephone and why ranata also seemssuspicious of us to begin with treat uslike we should know about the lack offair trials given to people like her whowere listening to broadcasts theyweren't supposed to we are part of theproblem we are part of the secret policecracking down on people's freedoms weare one of the bad guys and in one ofthe endings we actually do arrest Kurtleading him to be tortured by thegovernment and leading dictators to rulethe world so yeah while we may not be anevil Supernatural Force like the barabaYaga I think you could argue we'reactually much worse however it's at thispoint that I've got to be honest I'mgetting a little antsy we've solved alot of important details but none of itreally relied on the Slavic folklorethat made the first game so interestingsure it's nice to know that we aren'tsome kind of Supernatural being andinstead are a real monster a human beingbut if we aren't the mythologicalcreature in this story then who is Imean someone's got to be from folkloreright would be a bit depressing if thistime around there wasn't any newfolklore for us to dive into thankfullythough theorists there is someone whofeels in that need our new hospitablehost Kurt if you haven't noticed Kurt isa little bit Shady he kidnaps us wipesour memories lies to us constantly ohand he lies in our bed to watch us sleepdude at least buy me dinnerfirst and second thought maybe not butif none of that made you realize wecan't really trust him then take a lookat what Bara Yaga calls him during theend of the game I'm not telling heranything Kurt she's using quotationmarks around his name as if Kurt isn'tactually his real name just another lieso if Kur isn't who he says he is who ishe really we know that he's a characterwith a connection to the island of buanwe know that he has a connection to theBaba Yaga but the weirdest detail isactually from the end of the game whereBaba Yaga holds out an egg crushes itand in doing so HT literallydisintegrates before our very eyesthat's not usually how death works butit does tie him to a very specificcharacter from Slavic folklore kosi thedeathless like most Slavic villainsthere are a lot of stories about thisguy each with their own differentinterpretations in some he's Baba yaga'ssibling other times he's married to herwhich might explain why she keepscalling him sweetie in one of theflashbacks one of the most famousstories is sarovich PETA and The Wizardin it kosai isn't a supernatural beinglike the Baba Yaga he is instead awizard and he uses his magic for onespecific goal to achieve immortalitylooking at Kerr it's clear he has beendoing the same thing during the finalconfrontation Bara yag implies that Kurthas been around since the witch trialswhich in Europe were between the 15thand the 18th century so a good centuryand a half before this game takes placehe has managed to find immortality andin a conversation with Dimitri he voicesfrustration that the Bara Yaga is ableto achieve these sorts of things soeasily while he's having to use scienceold homes and rituals in order toachieve it just like kosai but Kurtclearly did manage to achieveimmortality in the exact same way kosaidid by disconnecting his soul from hisbody and putting it inside a needle hethen puts the needle inside an egg andputs that inside a duck and then insidea hair inside a box that is buried inthe forest on the island of buan theexact same place Kurt's Mansion islocated Plus at the end of the game BaraYaga finds the Box buried in the forestwith two bodies inside during an endingwhere we arrest Kurt he is accused ofimproper storage of animal remains andthroughout the game we've been hauntedby the spirits of Max the duck andclover the hair these these two Spiritsbelong to the two bodies inside that boxClover even references having their RibCage Broken open and having Max swninside there's also a bunch of otherreferences to koshai the deathlessthroughout the game Kurt's ceremonialroom underneath the Mansion contains athrone made for two people and a rustyiron sword which is referencing thispainting by Victor vov of another famousStory the death of kosi the deathless inthis story kosai steals the wife of themain character Ivan but Koshi is toofast to catch koshai however lets itslip that Baba Yaga has a faster horseand so Ivan goes to get it Baba Yagadoesn't want him to have it so in theend Ivan steals the horse she chases himbut fails and falls into a lake of firematching a nightmare that the Baba Yagahas during cooking companions but withKurt apologizing about Ivan stealing ahorse in the letter and in the finalconfrontation it's clear this wasn'tjust a nightmare it was an actual eventthat happened and Kurt is to blamebecause he is kosai and now he will paythe price for it so there you have itKurt is kosai the deathless a man thatenvied Baba yaga's ability to liveforever and so found his own means ofimmortality through dark magic andelaborate schemes but then what doesthis have to do with the secret TM Imentioned it at the start of thisepisode and if you've been following ourcoverage of these games you'll know thatthe secret has been a big mysterythroughout each installment of theseries in the first game potatocontinually asks Baba Yaga to tell himthe secret in the DLC we find out thatpotato has been desperate to learn thesecret since they were human and thenduring this game potato is still tryingto figure it out however despite itsconstant mentioning we've never trulyknown what the answer is which I guessmakes sense it is called the secret fora reason last time we came to theconclusion that it must have somethingto do with eternal life mainly based onpotato giving us this line in theoriginal game I'm living longer thanexpected already but this is goodinformation to take with me if he'sliving already it implies that thesecret would be able to extend his lifesomehow then when I first got to the endof this new game I felt like we hadpretty much nailed it in some of thegame's endings Kurt will hunt you downand kill you because you gave away thelocation of his soul egg to Baba Yagajust before he does though he gives youthis line you're given the GreatestSecret humans have ever known and yousquandered it during your differentplaythroughs kurk can give you a numberof different things but there is oneitem that is consistent regardless ofyour choices at the start of the gameyou are given a drink of water and oneof the responses you can give afterdrinking it is I think I swallowed ahair as the game goes on we find outthat yes it was in fact a hair Kurt hasmade everyone in the Mansion eat one ofhis hairs which in turn makes themImmortal just like he is so we are nowImmortal and according to Kurt that isthe secret that we have squandered socase closed the secret is eternal lifelife right well not exactly because ifyou do go on to kill Kurt potato saysthis why didn't you brew a stew of someof his hair I could have had a sip justenough to learn a secret why didn't youlet me ask him in this moment potatoseems to know what Kurt's hair does andbelieves if he drinks it then he willlearn the secret if all he wants iseternal life then why would he need tolearn about it after drinking a hairhe'd already have what he was afterwhich means eternal life cannot be thesecret or at least not the full secretearlier on when you find the Boxcontaining Kurt's Soul egg potato asksonce again can't I at least ask himabout a secret before you do it justleave me with his research papers I canfigure it out so the secret has to dowith Kurt's research and experimentationas we've discussed Kurt didn't achievehis immortality by natural means he usedscience and Magic to do so it eventuallyworked but in order to achieve it he hadto transfer his soul into something elsethat he could then hide somewhere safeduring the ending where we burn theMansion to the ground the duck Max alsomentions Kurt helping him achieve asimilar goal I used to hold out hopethat helping Kurt achieve his goalswould lead him to helping me letting myspirit rest or transferring me intoanother more capable body transferringme into another body just like Kurttransferred his soul into a needleinside an egg the secret isn't theability to live forever but the abilityto live forever and stay young andcapable by transferring your soul into anew body each time your old body Fadesthat is what potato has always wantedwhen he was human he wanted to be put ina more capable body and can you reallyblame him I mean look at that facethat's a face only a mother could lovebut now he wants out of his starchyprison to return to the world of theliving so that he can go on to killagain for himself but hang on a minutethis may have been how Kurt achieved hisimmortality but potato first tried tolearn this from the Baba Yaga and she'snot transferred her soul to stay alivethat was actually our first ever theoryon this franchise but it got debunkedthanks to the DLC so why would he haveasked her for the secret if the secretis soul transferring when herimmortality wasn't tied to that well shemay not have done it to herself but thatdoesn't mean the baraba Yaga hasn'tdabbled with a little manipulation onother people during the story bothDimitri and ranata die at the hands ofthe Baba Yaga and both of them turn intocreepy monster ghosts just like Mariahanatol and Gregor did in the originalgame we at first thought this washappening because they died outside thecabin which would make sense we aren'tin the cabin for this game either butthen onion comes along and gives us alittle more insight into how we killedranata and Dmitri tearing their Spiritsfrom their bodies was definitely theright move she didn't just kill them shetore their Spirits from their bodieslater on you can be shot by CT butremember we're still Immortal at thispoint despite being shot in the face butthen Baba Yaga cradles us in our armsand tells us our torment is over we feelthe knife press against us and suddenlywe end up in a white space with eitherDimitri or ranata depending on yourromance choices just like theirs ourSpirits have been allowed to move on andthat was only because the Bara Yagaremoved our spirit from our bodies shetoo has the ability to manipulate andmove souls and that is why potato firstwent to her for the secret however therevelations don't stop there because nowthat we understand what the secret is itactually begins to answer anotherquestion we've had since the originalgame ever since we first covered it wehave been wondering why it is thatchomet haunted the Bara Yaga as cutevegetables rather than angry Spiritslike Mariah Anatoli Gregor Renata orDimitri it's all because of what we'vejust been talking about the soulremember rata and Dimitri had theirsouls removed and from there they becamethe nightmare inducing spirits thatmeans for Mariah Anatolia and Gregor tobe the same the Baba Yaga also removedtheir Spirits after death so if youbecome a weird creepy ghost when yoursoul is removed does that mean the Chetsare the chomet because their soulsweren't removed the answer is aresounding yes because in dread weightwe also see what happens when you don'tremove a spirit after death when we findMax and Clover's corpses inside the boxin the woods they are very clearly deadat least according to potato and yettheir ghosts still haunt The Mansionthough they aren't angry Spirits likeranata or Dimitri instead they're a cutelittle duck and rabbit just like theadorable trumpets earlier I mentionedthat during Max's ending he wantsnothing more than to be transferred intoa more capable body but he also sayshe'd be happy if was just allowed tomove on just like ranata just likeDimitri and just like us the reason heand clover maintain these cute animalspirit forms is because their souls werenot removed from their bodies they'restill trapped inside unable to move onand that my friends is why the trumpetsare different unlike Mariah anatol andGregor the Baba Yaga ate these childrenbut didn't release their souls beforedoing so they are now stuck here unableto move on it may even be that thereason they're vegetables is becausetheir souls transferred into thevegetables that they were being cookedalongside we did hear the mention beingcooked inside of the oven or TheCauldron during the first game butthat's just speculation on my partregardless this is why they constantlybeg her to let them move on throughoutthe original cooking companions will youlet us go someday maybe all they want isto be free to have their Spiritstransferred and allowed to move on butBaba Yaga couldn't bring herself to doit because otherwise other wise she'd becompletely alone and as we've seen fromher relationship with Kurt to herrelationship with Karen to holding on topotato all she really wants are somecooking companions but hey that's just atheory a game theory thanks for watchingbut if you're looking for more datingSims with a side of horror why not checkout this oldie but a Goldie episode ondoy DOI literature Club just don't gettoo attached now theoriststake a look at this footage from FNAF 2seems normal enough right but what if Itold you that the mimic is in this videono I'm not lying to you and no I've notdoctored the footage either the mimic ishere they have been here since the verybeginning give up well if you look veryclosely you'll find that the mimic isthis guy righthere hello internets welcome to GameTheory the show that cannot believe ithas been 10 whole years of FNAF feelslike just yesterday I was watchingmarlier scream at this tiny unknownindie game and now it's an indie horrorEmpire full of games movies books andMore Much than a pizz Plex can handle 10years is a big deal believe me we wouldknow and so to celebrate Scott pulledout all the stops we got an anniversaryweek full of fanverse games demos booksmovie teasers and of course the CrownJewel that was into the pit though whilethat offers a lot in the way oftheorizing that's not what I wanted totalk about today don't worry that videois coming I just need a little more timeso make sure you're subscribed so youdon't miss that video when it dropsthere may also be a special theoristsurprise in store hint hint but for thisepisode instead of talking about thebiggest release of the week I wanted totalk about the biggest surprise you seewe knew about every release that washappening during this anniversary weekahead of time that was except for onesteel wool had a mystery announcementslot and a lot lot of us just assumed itwas going to be DLC for help wanted tobut that's not what we got instead steelwool completely sideswiped Us byrevealing a 40-second teaser not for DLCbut for a brand new game we open on a 70style carpet the camera tilts up toreveal a Jack In The Box playing musicthe music stops the Box opens and wehear a laugh as a clown mask Peaks outfrom the box the film re we're watchingbegins to burn up revealing the date1979 n finally we see a title cardappear from the darkness secret of themimic the internet lost their CollectiveMinds over this not only were we gettinga game exploring the character that wasa complete mystery when it appeared atthe end of Ruin unless you happen toread the books but it was also going tobe a prequel set before any other FNAFgame a lot of us have been theorizingabout the origins of Freddy's ever sincewe got the fredbear singing show ticketin security breach and in 2025 it lookslike we're going to see if we were rightbut you know what I'm not willing towait that long call me impatient butwhen you take a closer look this40-second teaser has actually told us alot more than you'd initially think thisteaser confirms that we were right thatthe mimic is from the earliest days inFazbear entertainment's history but italso suggests that the Mimi's firstappearance wasn't in ruin nor was itsecurity breach nor was it help wantedno we are being shown that the mimic hasactually been hiding in plain sightsince the very beginning the pieces werein place for us to figure it out we justweren't able to follow the breadcrumb orshould I say paper trail to realizesooner so wind up that music box friendsbecause when it opens we'll be diving inhead first to see what Secrets the mimichas been hiding and in doing so Ibelieve we may finally be able toresolve one of the biggest conflictscurrently facing the FNAF timeline awound first inflicted on me oh yeahtoday's going to be a big one so let'sget into it the first thing we got totalk about is the design of funky Tomover here jokey fan name aside given thetitle of this game it feels prettyunlikely that this is supposed to beanything other than the mimic but he'snot the disheveled Endo we saw in ruinnow he's wearing a white mask withexaggerated eyelashes rounded cheeks anda bright red nose I can feel thechildhood trauma rushing back it alsopops out of a Jack In The Box so clearlysteel will are going for a clownaesthetic with this newest version ofthe mimic or is it the oldest versionthis new old look does tie into ourprevious theories about the origins ofFazbear entertainment in that video wediscussed this poster from Help Wanted 2a poster with a circus tent and the date1970 on it that along with the mascotcostumes and the ruined basement glitchtraps design official artwork oftraditional mascot costumes andreferences throughout the books all seemto be telling us that Fazbearentertainment didn't start with thecreation of fredbear's Family Diner butas a traveling circus instead of theanimatronics or spring lock suits thatwe know and love today this circus usedmore traditional rudimentary mascotcostumes they were still the samecharacters Freddy Bonnie and Chica butplayed by human performers though therewas one exception we ended that theorysuggesting that the mimic was also partof that same fazbar circus it sharesdesign similarities with sun and moon aJester who was associated with thecarousel from the forfest circus acarousel that we watch burn repeatedlyand help wanted to we see the Festivalburn down both in the carousel level andin the fazer Blast Level and what elsedo we know is burnt the mimic in thefirst epilog of tales from the pizzzaPlex when the mimic arrives it is firstdescribed as being burnt thus it seemslike the mimic has been here since thatFall Fest in the 70s you might think Iwas celebrating this fact my first FNAtheory was right let's go but then theworry began to sink in it always feels abit wrong when a prequel introduces anew C character plus this franchisenever gets rid of characters we've had28 versions of Freddy 19 versions ofBonnie and we even got 11 versions ofballoon boy who asked for that so thenwhy try to awkwardly insert the mimicinto the previous law I mean Recon muchexcept what if I told you we have seenthis clown before somewhere you'd neversuspect FNAF 2 I am of course talkingabout the characters I've been teasingsince the start of the episode episodethe paper Pals no I wasn't joking theseguys really are the key to everything ifyou don't know who I'm talking about thepaper pals are these simple charactersmade from paper plates that have beenhanging out on the walls of peteras eversince their introduction to this daywe've never really given them muchthought they never seem to be thatimportant but their continued existencein the franchise has always struck me asunusual in fact the only reason I wasreminded of them is because I waswatching Doros playthrough of into thehit and wouldn't you know it they areonce again just hanging out for them tokeep showing up especially in thesemodern titles they have to be importantand I think the weird clown mimic is thepiece that ties them all togetheroriginally there were three of theseguys a Freddy pal a bonny pal and thisthing according to the game files he'sjust called paper buddy and of the threehe's definitely the weird one in FNAF 2he could just disappear from the walland suddenly appear in your office hedidn't do anything thing he was justthere now even his design feels out ofplace the other two are clearlycharacters we know Freddy and Bonnie duhbut this guy doesn't have anyrecognizable features he's got red armsblue legs a big smile and a big noseit's just so weird in a series full ofanimal characters why have this generichumanoid looking thing naturally theonly logical explanation we had at thetime was that this had to be balloon boyhe was one of the few humanoidcharacters we knew about by FNAF 2 andhe wears a red and blue outfit but nowthat I'm looking back I'm not so sureanymore for Bonnie and Freddy we aren'tjust relying on the colors to show uswho they are they have extra designdetails that connect them to theiriconic characters bow TI's hat ears thatsort of thing if this paper buddy wassupposed to be balloon boy why not givehim some of his iconic attire like thepropeller hat or the sign or you know aballoon the thing he is literally knownfor what this therefore implies to me isthat paper buddy is actually supposed tobe someone else someone with a muchsimpler design and the answer of whobecomes extremely obvious when you takea look at their appearance in FNAF worldthat's right not only were these guysconsidered important enough to beplayable characters in one of theweirdest entries in this series butScott also used it to give us a vitalclue about who this guy was supposed tobe and it's all because of one teenytiny design change we've gone over paperBuddy's design already the red arms bluelegs buttons big smile happy eyes bignose all of that is the same in FNAFweld except for his nose it's still asbig as before and it's in the same placebut the color is now different it's beenchanged to red and a red nose means onething clowns what we're seeing is paperBuddy's design matching exactly with theiconic design of clowns and thereforealso matches what we've seen seen fromthe mimic in this latest teaser now Irecognize that this feels like a stretchthis is all down to interpretation andcould be taken a number of differentways believe me I was honestly unsure ofall of this too that was until I foundthis the final clue that absolutelysealed the deal for me that paper buddyis the mimic take a look at the attacksthe paper Pals have in FNAF world thefirst two are prize Ball 2 and MysteryBox 2 both generic attacks that wouldmake sense for any character in anyPizzeria but the third and final attackis called something very specific mimicball a move that mimics the last attackused I could not believe it when I sawthis of all of the games it was FNAFWorld showing us that the paper Palswere specifically able to mimic othersthe third paper pal from FNAF 2 paperbuddy is a paper version of the newclown mimic that we saw in the teaser inmy previous Theory mentioned how FNAF 2isn't a revamp of the old franchise buta call back to the circus origins of thefranchise the red cheeked toyanimatronics were calling back to theoriginal costumes worn at the circus youhave the carousel calling back to theCarousel from forest that we got to seein help one to and now we have paperbuddy calling back to the clown mimicthat was present at that same circus itall just fits together so neatly itcould also explain the clown mask inthings like sister location the one thatwould later to go on to become Enard whyis that mask in such a position ofprominence because it was the thirdmember of that original circus Triosomeone who had been there since thebeginning although speaking of Triowhile paper buddy being the mimic andappearing in FNAF 2 makes sense himbeing grouped with Freddy and Bonniefeels a bit odd right even for the earlydays of the franchise a clown isn't theobvious one to pair with Freddy andBonnie cheer I'd have understood maybeeven foxy but this guy is just so Randomif you've followed us for a while you'llknow that we are obsessed with thesekinds of details the grouping ofanimatronics through merchandise orDecor can often tell us a lot about thehistory of the franchise we felt likeFoxy had to come later because he had aseparate stage to the other three itfelt like chica wasn't originally partof the group either because she had ourown party world spin-off during sisterlocation and in ruin we figured out thatsun and moon came much earlier becausethey were getting Collectibles alongsideOG car characters while newcomers likeRoxy and Monty weren't so placing themimic clown alongside Freddy and Bonniehas to imply there's a specialconnection between the three so why makethe mimic the awkward third wheelalongside this famous Duo well it turnsout the rule of Threes isn't just animportant literary technique it was alsosuper important for performances at thecircus particularly when it comes toclowns in a traditional circus you wouldhave three major clown archetypes theAUST clown the white face clown and theContra AUST clown we spoke about theAUST clown in our previous Theory theseclowns were the ones with red cheeksthat were designed to appear silly andmake children laugh often they wereportrayed as an intelligent but LowerClass Clown the laborer the one whowould do a job often badly which led tothem getting a pie in the face orfalling off a ladder you know thetypical slapstick stuff the Whitefaceclowns on the other hand are supposed tobe more serious and bossy they were of ahigher status and so they would beresponsible for assigning the tasks tothe August clown and would often becomefrustrated at their failed resultsfinally you have the Contra orust clownwho was the middle ground still lowerclass than the white face clown but notto the same degree as the AUST clown andlooking into clown literature which yesis a thing that I read the Contra ao'srole was to do one thing mimic the whiteface clown no I'm not making that up itwas right there on the page in front ofme what we now have are three distinctcharacters a serious boss clown a smartworker clown and a mimicking clown nowlook at who we have at the start ofFreddy's while we don't know a whole lotabout the specifics of this Fazbearcircus we do know one thing Henry andWilliam were actively performing duringthe early days of the franchise one as abear and one as a rabbit Fred Bear andspring Bonnie William was thebusinessman the serious one the guy whowas trying to make Fazbear a success theWhiteface clown then there's Henry theintelligent laborer who was building theanimatronics the orust clown and now wehave a third paper buddy the mimic aclown animatronic that has been theresince the early days of the franchisenow mimicking the past actions of thewhite face clown William Afton makingthem the Contra or goose in this Triothree clowns three performers threepaper poers that have been there sincethe start but sadly choosing afon to bethe one to mimic wasn't the bestdecision when this trailer was announcedBrian freyou the design director atSteel World tweeted about it saying theevil that men do lives after them thegood is of interred with their bonesthis is a quote from Shakespeare'sJulius Caesar my immediate reaction wasoh yeah this is about afon being deadand now here's evil lives on in themimic who is now continuing to hurt andkill people Beyond his death like we'vebeen predicting this whole time but asI've thought it over I think it might besomething more than that I actuallythink that this line is telling us themain plot point that we will see insecret of the mimic a plot point thatwill finally answer the question thathas haunted me ever since the release ofhelp wanted to what did Henry mean by awound first inflicted on me this linecomes from the insanity ending of FNAF 6Henry talks about how afon used TheSouls of the children he'd killed tocreate Remnant and then continued totorture them to create the fun times butthe most important part of thatmonologue is when he turns inwards andbegins reflecting on his own part in allof this he he ends up saying he needs toheal this wound a wound first inflictedon me one that I let bleed out for thelongest time we believe this wasreferencing afon killing his daughterCharlie she was afton's first victimwhich led on to the killing of all themissing children that was the wound thatwas inflicted on Henry the death of hisown daughter that then bled out thedeath of so many others but then helpwanted to came out and it flipped thatentire idea on its head in that game wehad to light six gravestones in aspecific order to receive the secretBonny mask each grave had a differentpuppet next to it each referencing oneof the six main animatronics FreddyBonnie Chica foxy golden Freddy and thepuppet the five missing children andCharlie however Charlie isn't the firstgrave you light she's actually the lastone heavily implying that Charlie wasthe last to be killed honestly I don'thate it from a law standpoint there's adecent amount of evidence that can lineup with it but by suggesting that itthrew in to question that line of awound first inflicted on me being aboutCharlie's death instead there had to bean earlier incident that wounded Henrythat would metaphorically bleed outleading to the missing children'sincident and the death of Charlie sowhat do I think this event is well itall comes back to that Shakespeare quotethe line that Brian tweeted is deliveredby the character Mark Anthony atCaesar's funeral Caesar was murdered bythe character Brutus however Anthonyisn't able to directly accuse himpublicly so instead he tactfully talksaround the issue calling Brutus anhonorable man this dynamic betweenAnthony and Brutus I suspect is meant tobe a reflection of Henry and AftonBrutus was able to get close to Caesarbecause Caesar loved him which issimilar to the tactic used by afonthroughout this series put on the springbunny costume a character that thechildren loved and use it to lure theminto a back room and kill them for thisquote to be used to promote the prequelgame from 1979 it's telling us that afonwas abusing the love of this characterway before the missing children'sincident and this early murder at thehands of Aton is what I believe we willbe seeing in secret of the mimic maybeit will even be revealed as aton's firstit's unclear if the person Aton killswill be a major character like Caesar isin the play or whether it's just anotherkid with the importance more being howearly it is in the timeline we only havea 40-second trailer after all much moreis going to be revealed as time goes onbut what is important is if William isBrutus Henry must be Anthony and thatmeans he knew William committed themurder that murder is going to be thewound inflicted on Henry on the Fazbearbusiness on their friendship that murdercould have destroyed everything theybuilt but as we know it didn't and afonwould go on to kill again because justlike Anthony Henry isn't going to accusehim directly maybe he was concerned forhis businesses survival maybe he wasconcerned about providing for his newdaughter Charlie maybe he just wanted tobelieve his friend could change butwhatever his reasoning despite the woundAfton caused him he never came out andadmitted what he knew he just allowed itto keep going allowed afon to keepkilling English philosopher John StewartMill once said a person may cause evilto others not only by his actions but byhis inaction and in either case he isjustly accountable to them for theinjury that is why he feels so guilty inthe insanity speech because he knowsthat his inaction in that moment fromthe circus led to the creation of notone not two but three monsters Williamthe yellow rabbit that would go on tokill so many children the clown that wasdesigned to mimic afon now carrying onhis horrible Legacy and himself the manwho stood by and let the first murderhappen leading to the deaths of so manyothers including his own daughter Iguess at the end of the day they reallywere the perfect Trio but hey I think wecan all agree that we've got a lot tolook forward to with FNAF so many newgames were demoed or teas during

to Ubisoftfor the experience and for sponsoringthis video but you guys have open thetheorist floodgates so time to find outThis is the most requested
episode of Game Theory ever.Over the last two months, we've received hundreds
upon hundreds of requests to play this game.Our subreddit is practically
bursting at the seams.Our comment section is overflowing.People are hungry for this game.So today, I will answer the call.Today, I will cover the game that
you have all been dying to see.Today, I will be theorizing
about Dress to Impress.No, no, no, no, wait, it's scarier than it sounds.Trust me.Hello, Internet.Welcome to Game Theory, the show
that never goes out of style.Although, I became very unsure of my
own personal style when I tried myhand at the Roblox game that everyone had
been requesting I play, Dress to Impress.It seemed simple enough.You just pick outfits, hairstyles, get your nails
done, all to try and match the chosen theme.Only for you to lose regardless because people
vote on what's cute rather than what's on theme.How on earth is this kawaii?So I have to say, I was a little
confused why this was so requested.I thought maybe Amy and I could do a
collab episode about the psychologybehind why the theme didn't really seem to matter.But then your comments pointed something out.A book.And it would change everything.It turns out, it's not just
these outfits that are sus.What started as a simple April Fool's updatehas now become four months of nearly
daily updates across multiple games.All to tell a story of
tragedy, betrayal, and revenge.And so, I've been following along,
writing down my thoughts with eachnew update, theory crafting in
real time to try and solve it.So, sorry Amy, no collab today because
I gotta take a peek behind the fashionshow curtain myself and find out what hidden
lore is hiding inside of Dress to Impress.That's what you get for caking me.So, what is this random book that totally
changed my perspective of the game?On the surface, it's just
a simple diary entry froman NPC nail technician that the
community has dubbed Nail Lady.Although, she doesn't seem
particularly fond of that name.Ahem.Ugh.Fine, I guess we can still collab.You can do the voice.The world's not ready for
my feminine voice anyway.Thank you, Tom.Ahem.They just call me Nail Lady when
I am so much more than that.My name is Lana, but no one calls me that.I'm gonna run away one day.Sounds pretty understandable, right?She just wants people to call her by her name,
but that's not what got everyone's attention.What stood out was on the next page,where she writes that she wants to "set fire
to the studio" and reveals a list of targets.She even has "Dealt With" written
next to some of the names.I mean, I'm sure we all have
that one colleague we don't like,but offing them might be a bit overdramatic.Maybe.Though it turns out, these aren't her colleagues.If you take a closer look at the names, some
of them are the names of the game's developers.Okay, cool.We've got a murdery protagonist who is
unhappy with the life the devs gave her,and so she is offering them one by one.Pretty straightforward, right?Well, it was until updates started rolling in.Lana's diary was no longer on full display,
but instead was hidden at the top of a cabinet.However, it was still readable,
and it said something new.That isn't me.They replaced me with some doppelganger.That's not me.I'm Lana.She's not.But she's pretending to be me.I don't know where I am.Gigi is holding me somewhere, so I can't escape.Please help me.I am so scared, and I hope that that thing
sitting in my salon chair doesn't harm my image.I think she's the reason why all
the players are going missing.And then, if you take a look at the
wall, you'll see three missing posters,the names of which match three of the
developers from Lana's target list.That person she mentions, Gigi, is also a
developer, and she has now taken Lana hostage,replacing her with this doppelganger, and not
the kind with extra eyes and missing mouths.All of this is to keep the game running smoothly,
so people wouldn't suspect she was gone.However, this is slightly confusing.Lana claims that these people are
missing because of this doppelganger,but the target list that matches the
missing posters came from her diary.Or was that actually the doppelganger's diary?I'm not entirely sure who I'm
supposed to be trusting here,but the diary does give us a Roblox user ID that
leads us to Lana's Roblox profile, LanaDoesNails.So we should probably start there, and
oh boy, this is where the fun begins.On her page is a link to a YouTube
account with a handful of short videos.The first video is called Awakening.A face appears and tells Lana,How dare you, Lana, spread our plans?Already, we're off to a mysterious start.Lana has betrayed whatever this Awakening is.I assume by telling us about the doppelganger.In a later video, Ode to Myself, she
once again mentions this wretched group.But in the description, tells us she's
trying to warn us that we are next.Is this group trying to take over the game?To replace all the players with mindless
doppelgangers that just follow the rules?Maybe they're also mad that
people aren't playing it right.There is one more video, but it
doesn't really give us anything new.So, I went back to Lana's Roblox page
and looked around for more clues.If you look under the Creations tab, you can see
that Lana is actually making a game of her own.And it's called Forest.It invites us to view the truth of Lana's story.Given that we're specifically looking
for lore, this is an enticing offer.But be warned, this game is
nothing like Dress to Impress.A blood-red filter covers the screen.Eerie music plays in the background.And a human eye is constantly watching you.As you wander through the forest, you can
find sentences that tell the story of Lana.That she was diagnosed with a terminal
illness that left her and her family in debt.And that she now works in
the salon just to get by.Given her diary told us
she hates it there so much,I suspect she turned to this
Awakening group for help.It would be classic cult-like manipulation.They promise her financial support only for them
to turn on her when she doesn't fall in line.And I think I might be right,
because as you explore the forest,Lana's doppelgangers try to kill you.This is the truth that they want hidden.But if you manage to avoid them,you can find a podium that requires
four people to open a portal to a maze.Get to the end, and you'll receive
a binary code that translates to...You may have finished your trials,
but the evil lurks throughout.This is not the end. There will be chaos.Well, chaos is usually bad, so I suppose
we should probably help Lana stop it.Fortunately, when I returned to Lana's page,
she had created a group called Saudade.Which is described as "the birth of an uprising.A new dawn where we stand united
against the forces of evil".Alright, let's go!Inside the group, there are a few subgroups too.One of which is called Coterie.A word that means "an exclusive group of persons
with a unifying common interest or purpose".Lana is already out here building a rebellion.Gathering people through the common
goal of exposing the Awakening.That is what led her to get
locked up in the first place.There's also another group called
Missing, and it contains four people.But these aren't the
developers, they're just people.These must be the missing people that
Lana was referring to in her diary.The ones the Awakening caused to go missing.She was trying to stop others from disappearing
by taking out the developers from the Awakening.I'm sorry that I doubted your innocence, Lana.Is what I would say if it wasn't
for this missing person's bio.You see, it's not a normal bio like most of them.It contains a Caesar Cipher.There are a few small mistakes in the
translation, but cleaned up, it says this.My death was planned by Lana, not evil.The Coterie's not just some group to help her.They're her sacrifices.Ha! I knew it!Cancel my therapy, guys!My trust issues are well-founded!Lana has been convincing us this whole
time that she is one of the good guys.That she was taken advantage of by the Awakening.But no!These missing people aren't just missing.They've been sacrificed by
the Awakening and by Lana.She was in on it the whole time.Or so I thought if it wasn't for
Lana's next game, Questionnaire.Here she'd appear for live events
to set the record straight.She confirmed some things like how the Awakeninglured her in by promising to
pay off her financial debts.But as these live streams kept happening,
her answers began to contradict that truth.Suddenly, she actually loved the nail salon,which means she probably wouldn't have turned
to the Awakening for help in the first place.She also started saying that they weren't
evil, but people have been murdered.That's pretty evil.Is she being coerced again?Nope! Red text appeared on screen and said...Don't believe her!Please!That is not the real Lana!And everyone got booted out of the
stream with the reason listed as..."I am the real Lana."The Lana we've been talking
to was another doppelganger.The real Lana is innocent.But then Questionnaire got an update that addeda house with a new version of
Lana's diary that said this...Jayla's eyes are gone.Nicholas's heart is gone.Jisoo's voice is gone.And Sadie has been taken apart.I pray that this stays private.And no one finds out my true
intentions with the Saudade.I cannot believe how easy it's been to make
these players believe that I am the victim.And now they're all on my side.They will all pay for how they treated me.So that whole kicking us off to get rid
of the doppelganger was also just a stunt.Lana has been playing the victim,making us believe anything bad was a
doppelganger working for the Awakening.But really, Lana was the villain behind it all.I tell ya, this story's got more
twists than an M. Night movie.After this reveal, Lana went full villain mode,executing three members of
the Coterie live on air.But the last member, Nelly,
wasn't going down so easily.Now what happened to Nicholas and all the people
you killed, sacrificed, is going to happen to youSeeing through Lana's deceit, Nelly
flips the script and kills her instead.Finally, Lana's reign of
tyranny and deceit would end.But I'm sure you could all figure
out where this is going, right?Once the dust settles,Lana's YouTube account posted a video
called The Last Serenade, and it said...There's still more to come.This time, it will be successful,
because I've opened the gate.That Lana that was just killed was a doppelganger.Again.But now, she's achieved her goal,
which was opening a gate, apparently?The keen-eyed among you will probably
recognize it from the Forest game.The gate that needed four people to activate it.And we now have three dead Coterie
members and Lana's dead doppelganger.Four bodies to help Lana open this new gate.Killing the Coterie members
wasn't about protecting herown skin or defending the Awakening.It was always part of her plan.And it's likely why she had sacrificed
the first four missing victims.But that, ladies and gentlemen,
was the end of Chapter 1.And there were two major
questions that everyone had.What is the portal, and why did Lana need it?Well, before we dive into
Chapter 2, here's what I think.Typically, when it comes to cults and sacrifices,portals would be used to summon
some kind of evil entity.However, the portal in the Forest that lookedidentical to this new one took
us to a new location instead.So, Lana and the Awakening aren't trying
to summon something, but go somewhere.Lana's motivations still seem
tied to what we saw in her diary.She wants to burn the salon to the ground,and she likely still wants to destroy
the devs who made her life so horrible.They designed her boring NPC life.They designed her tragic backstory.And so I suspect whatever lies beyond
this portal will help her to achieve that.Maybe she needs to find some demonic
monster to bring back and kill everyone.Or maybe this new world has some kind of
item that can make her an all-powerful being,able to transcend the game and
destroy the devs completely.Maybe it'd even allow her to enter our world.All of this would certainly
fit with the culty vibes.But whatever the answer is, I gotta
say I'm kinda hooked on this one.I know I've been sighing about the constant back
and forth of Doppelgangers versus the real Lana,but I'm just really impressed that there's thismany twists hidden inside
a Roblox Runway Simulator.So I just wanted to take a minute to say thank
you guys for recommending this game to me.I'd have never known about this fascinating
experience if it wasn't for you.So please, if you've got recommendations, please
do let me know down in the comments below.I love getting exposed to new games,and I especially love covering games
that I know that you guys want to see.But I should stop with all this mushy
stuff because Chapter 2 is here,so it's time to see if I'm right.After a little bit of time, the Soudade added
a new group to its affiliate tab called Plague,showing the same portal that
we'd seen in Lana's latest video.But the creator of the group wasn't Lana.It's someone named Agamemnon.Ugh, that is going to be the worst thing to say.I'm gonna call you Aggy. Sound good?At the same time this new group was
made, Lana also made a post saying,Agamemnon, I hear your call. I hear it well.I am following your voice, and perhaps it
will lead me to the portal you told me about.Sounds to me like this guy is trapped
on the other side of the portal,in some kind of alternate world or dimension.That's why Lana needs the portal.
It's to free him or to be with him.Was this really just a tragic
love story this whole time?Soudade does mean the nostalgic longing
for a beloved yet absent person.So that kind of makes sense, but her
words also feel a bit too cult-y for me.So we could still be on the right track if he
turns out to be some kind of all-powerful demon.And we don't have to wait that long because
Lana released another game called The Fortress,and the start of it is on the other
side of the portal that Lana had opened.There are words written across the walls like
plague, metamorphosis, and I finally feel free.They're written over and over and over again,like the writings of a lunatic
trapped in a room for years.So basically me when the new
Poppy Playtime ARG dropped.Across the map, there are
notes from both Lana and Nelly,spelling out that while this is the real Lana,she's basically been brainwashed by
the guy she's following, good old Aggy.This stinks of classic cult leader behavior.A man who gathers others around him to worship
him like he's the second coming of Christ,filling people's heads with promises that
will all turn out to be lies in the end.Lana isn't in love with this guy, or maybe
she is, cult relationships are kind of weird,but it's more like she sees him as her savior
and will help her to get revenge on the Salon,which never ends well in these kinds of things.Lana will likely end up betrayed
at best or dead at worst.But now, ladies and gentlemen, it's
finally time to hear from Aggy himself,because you can find two doors
that require passwords to enter.The note next to the first one reads,call it, open the door, bestow me the truth.So we just repeat that second
phrase, bestow me the truth.That leads to a second door
which asks us, what is coming?The walls speak the truth.Well, we saw three things
written on the walls earlier.Finally, I feel free, metamorphosis, and plague.And it's that last one that opens the door.Inside, we find Aggy's helmet in the corner,revealing this to be his office, and
several notes are pinned to the wall.Aggy has been the one creating the
doppelgangers, which makes sense.Thanks to them, Lana deceived everyone
and was able to open the gate.But what did he mean by Lana is perfect?Cult leaders like this
always have ulterior motives,so what does her being perfect mean for him?Is it that she's the perfect
follower? The perfect bride?This has to be important.So I decided to look a little more
into Aggy, more specifically his name.And no, not just because it's hard to pronounce.This game has already used a
few words with deeper meaning,so I wondered if this would be the same for him.Turns out Agamemnon isn't just a random name.It comes from Greek mythology,
specifically the Trojan War.Agamemnon was leading an army to Troy by boat,and during the trip incurs the
wrath of the goddess Artemis.He's told that the only way to appease
her is to sacrifice his daughter.If he doesn't, then the army will
continue to suffer misfortune,most notably a plague, just like
the door to Aggy's room said.It asked what is coming,
and the answer was a plague.So if a plague is on the way, that would
mean that Aggy needs to sacrifice someoneto appease whoever he angered, someone
that was perfect, someone like Lana.But then why bother with the doppelgangers?Well, in some versions of the myth, Agamemnon
tries to deceive Artemis with fake offerings,to trick her into thinking he killed
his daughter, but never really did.That is what the doppelgangers are for.If he can create one that is a perfect copy,
then he can sacrifice them and keep Lana alive.Is this guy actually a hero here?Trying to save humanity from a
plague and save Lana from her fate?Yeah, no.Another note in the fortress written by Aggy says,I need to create the perfect doppelganger.Lana will help me, and when all
is done, I will get rid of her.And there it is.Thanks to Lana, he can kill her, while also havinga perfect doppelganger that
has all of her influence,while also following his commands.He would have full control of the sawdad
and all of the users that are a part of it.At this point, I was feeling
pretty good about the story.It felt like we had a backstory, a motive, an
idea of where the story was moving towards.That was until I discovered this
note hiding behind the bookcase.It's so easy to manipulate those
that are blind to others' tactics.While I feel bad, I just remember that Lana,
the real one, is just a vessel that empowers me.Okay, so I guess he isn't going to sacrifice Lana?At first, I thought of the vessel as a
container, something that stores something else.And given my theorizing in the indie horror scene,I wondered if she was going to become
a vessel for someone else's soul.Maybe Aggy's daughter from the
Greek myth, or maybe Aggy himself,but it all just felt like too much of a stretch.Outside of the myth, there's been no mention of
a daughter or really anything to do with souls.But then I remembered that
vessel has another meaning.It can also be referencing a ship
like Agamemnon used to sail to Troy.Lana isn't going to contain Aggy's spirit.She's just the metaphorical ship that
he can use to escape this fortress.She's the one that opened the portal,
something he couldn't have done without her.And now she's going to empower him to escape.But how?Well, in one note, he says this.I consume the parts Lana gives me.My true form will be victorious.I just need more parts to fulfill me.We heard from Lana's diary that the missing
people had their eyes and limbs taken out.Well, this is where they went.Aggy is using them to create his true
form so that he can escape this dimension.On Lana's YouTube channel, a new video got
posted showing security footage of Aggy and Lanasacrificing the last KOTORi member, Nelly.But instead of sacrificing her at a
live event, Aggy unleashes a monster.We only catch glimpses of it, but it's a very talland misshapen humanoid body
covered in eyes and teeth.Aggy remarks to Lana,Was it not what you were expecting?No, Aggy, this is not what any of us wereexpecting when you said you
were making your true form.I was expecting the most
chattified Roblox character ever,but instead you went full Vita Carnis on me.But while that reveal was confusing
and a little disappointing,there was another reveal in this moment.Lana, out of nowhere, feels regret.Nelly, I'm so sorry.In the live stream, she tried
to kill Nelly with zero remorse.But in this video, she's apologizing.Later on, Lana begins sacrificing
members of the Soudad group,Horizon, a group filled with real Roblox users.But if you look around the room during the stream,you can find some strange
text above the chamber door.Another Caesar cipher.And it says,I'm so sorry.I didn't want to do this to the
Horizon, but A made me do it.This feels like a big shift in her personality.Until now, she's been freely killing people.Anyone that rebelled against
Aggy liked the coterie easy.But now, Aggy requires innocent
people to be sacrificed.But suddenly, his hold on her began to fade.And then she released one final game.Sanagen's Gallery, which in
Swedish means gallery of truth.As soon as you start the game,
you are met with a list of rules.But the most important rule is
everything you see here is truth.Lana, the real Lana, is finally
giving us her side of things.No more doppelgangers, no more lies.Just her.There are a lot of photos of Lana in this gallery.But the deeper you go, you can
start to find plaques next to them.Lana, the one who tells the truth.The one you should trust.Lana, the real one.The one that isn't in the chair.Vessel, you'll meet her soon.Once innocent, pure, and serene.Most of these make sense.Lana is telling us the truth here.The Lana in the livestream chairs
has always been a doppelganger.And we've talked about how Lana is going
to be Aggy's mean of escape, his vessel.But what is this apple thing about?The quote about losing innocence matches
the Christian symbolism for apples.The fruit that was eaten by Adam and Eve from
the tree of the knowledge of good and evilthat made them lose their innocence.However, we've spent a bit of time
looking at Greek mythology this episode.So I thought I'd have a look to see
if apples had any importance there.And oh boy, do they!Specifically, in the story
with our good friend Aggy.The Trojan War.The story began because Paris of Troy had
to choose who was the fairest goddess.Hera, Athena, or Aphrodite.He ends up choosing Aphrodite, but she actuallybribed him by offering him
Helen of Sparta as a bride.However, she was already married to
none other than Agamemnon's brother.Sending the two nations to war with each other.But the thing that forced Paris to choose
between the goddesses in the first placewas a golden apple that had to
the fairest one inscribed upon it.It became known as the Apple of Discord.And if you take a look at the
badges for the Fortress game,you'll find one called the Judgment of Paris.The same name given to the
start of this Greek myth.For Lana to be described here as an apple,it could be referencing her sowing
discourse amongst the community.The real Lana having regrets and
changing her mind is ruining Aggy's plan.But you know what? I'm gonna take a bit of a
swing here and say it's actually something bigger.If the apple is what caused Agamemnon to go to
war and endure all that suffering in the myth,what if Lana, as the apple here,is somehow responsible for Aggy
being trapped in the first place?Aggy clearly doesn't care for Lana.He calls her a pawn in his game,someone he's okay with getting rid
of once their usefulness has stopped.He even questions if she is perfect
when he's making the doppelgangers.He doesn't want to use her, but he has to.And looking back through the Fortress map,you can find an apple on Aggy's
desk with an arrow going through it.He cannot help but telegraph his disdain
for her, and yet she is completely unaware.It would also be quite a poetic narrative,having the person who is somehow responsible forgetting him trapped there being
the only way that he can get out.It is a bit of a leap, I'll admit.But the leap from chapter 1 to 2 was also
quite big, so who knows with this series?But there you have it, theorists.After four months of waiting, we finally
have uncovered the law of dress to impress.The story of a girl fallen on hard
times, upset with her lot in life,and sought help from a cult
that promised her the world.She was swayed by the charms of its leader,who took her under his wing, using her to
make doppelgangers to deceive everyone.Sacrificing players to make his perfect
form and free him from his prison.Or at least, that's what I
think is happening right now.This game is still updating almost
daily, which is really impressive,but as a little peek behind the theorist curtain,our scripts are usually written two to three
weeks before you guys ever see a video.So, when a game like this is updating so
often, it becomes nearly impossible to makea theory that isn't gonna get debunked
just days after I finish recording.Hi, future Tom here. That
is exactly what happened.There weren't as many updates as I was expecting,seems they're mainly waiting
for the Halloween update,but there was a livestream where
Lana clarified one crucial detail,that we were wrong about her being the vessel.Turns out, the vessel is actually this fleshyroom that you can find hidden in
the corner of Dress to Impress,that the community has dubbed the Meat Room.I mean, we only thought that Lana
was this vessel because, you know,she was literally referred
to as the vessel by Aggy.But, okay, if this room is the
vessel, what does that mean?Well, given all the references to the
Trojan War, I think this Meat Room,this vessel, must have to be related
to the famous vessel from that story,the Trojan Horse.Something that was able to sneak the
Greeks into enemy territory and destroy it.This Meat Room is the vessel
that will transport Aggy fromthe fortress into the world of Dress to Impress,into his enemy's territory,
where his true form will beable to take revenge and destroy
everything, just like in the myth.But don't worry, Lana isn't totally useless now.In that weird Meat Room, a key has also been
added, one with the name Lana attached to it.So, while she may not be the actual
vessel, she's definitely the key to it.In Lana's latest YouTube video, she
shows the Dress to Impress world,only now it's dark, red, covered
in eyes, and we see another portal.I could see Lana or her doppelgangers
doing one final sacrifice.One that will open up the portal and allow Aggy toescape his prison through
the vessel, the Meat Room,and then he will be able to
enact his revenge and turnthe world into that hellscape we see in the video.The only other thing I'll note is that Lana
seems to have completely lost her sense of guilt,and is back to being fully gung-ho
about taking over Dress to Impress.Given her past changes like this, I
wouldn't be at all surprised if wehave another doppelganger on
our hands, just lying to us.So, who knows, maybe Lana will turn
out to be the vessel after all.But regardless, I think we can all
agree that this game is fascinating.I don't think anybody would have expected this
level of storytelling from a game like this.So, I tip my hat to you, developers, keep it up.I, for one, am very excited
to see where things go next.But in the meantime, remember,
it's all just a theory.A game theory!Thanks for watching.And if you've enjoyed uncovering the dark
secrets behind a seemingly innocent game,then you should definitely check out our
episode on the very disturbing Lacey Games.Step through the portal, theorists.Buckshot Roulette has stumped me not once, but
twice. I wanted so desperately to find the loreof this game when it first came out, but it was
so well hidden that it just didn't seem possible.Then, out of nowhere, we got ourselves
an official ARG inside the game. Finally!Something that could give me the answers I
needed! Except, I can't solve it. Once again,I felt the lore slipping out of my theorist grasp.
So, for this one, I'm gonna need some help fromyou. Hello internet! Welcome to Game Theory,
the show that knows that every theory is abouttaking big risks. And today, we are talking about
a game that has been requested a lot since thestart of this year. Buckshot Roulette. A simple
game that's already blown the brains out of over 2million players. This game was super enticing
to everyone online thanks to its simulated highstakes, its ability to make you wince at a fake
scenario, and of course, a feeling that there wasmore to this game's story than meets the eye. But
that final point never really revealed itself.Sorry Mark. Don't get me wrong, I certainly tried,
as did many others, but it never felt like anyonehad a full grip on what this game was supposed
to be about. That was, until April of this year.Hidden inside the April update for the game was
a small detail that changed everything. A liveemail address. And from there, came a website,
and a whole ARG that was designed to do just that.Help us understand the Buckshot lore. Immediately,
my passion was revitalized, and I threw everythingI had at this ARG, trying desperately to find
the answers. And while I and the community havecertainly found a good amount of stuff, we're
still missing one vital clue to busting thiswhole thing wide open. So grab your YouTube
friendly firearms theorists, because I'm goingto need your help to solve this. Let me show you
the story we have so far, and then reveal what youcan do to help uncover the lore of Buckshot
Roulette. You start Buckshot Roulette in thebathroom of a club. You don't really have many
options except to click on the door in front ofyou and move out onto a catwalk where a smoker
overlooks the club below. From here, click onthe next door and you enter into a small room
stuffed with various tech. This is where theShotgun Roulette begins. If the name didn't give
it away, this game is based on Russian Roulette,where someone uses a gun loaded with a
single live round, aims it at themselves,and hopes it doesn't go off. In Buckshot Roulette
though, things are a little more complicated.There are only two players, yourself and the
dealer, and you have a shotgun with a certainamount of live rounds and blank rounds. Using a
combination of counting bullets, logic, and powerups, the player needs to figure out the order
of the shells and use them to deal damage to thedealer while avoiding any themselves. If you get
it wrong, you end up with a face full of lead andyou're brought back with a defibrillator. Which
feels like putting a bandaid on a severed limb,but regardless, the third round is where things
get exciting. The defibrillators get cut. No morerevivals this time. Either you or the dealer are
getting buried after this. If you win however,a machine emerges from the darkness with a
briefcase full of cash, up to $70,000 worth,which you now get to spend on facial
reconstruction surgery. Woo! Totally worth it. Orat least it would be if after your victory, you
didn't wake up again in the same bathroom readyto go again. They even give you a bottle of pills
to activate the double or nothing endless mode ifyou really fancy a challenge. And that is the
game. It's a very fun gameplay loop and it allowsfor some really interesting mental gymnastics
while trying to outsmart the dealer. But froma lore standpoint, there wasn't really much to
go off of. Obviously there were questions like,what the heck is the dealer's deal? How is
he able to survive a shotgun to the face withno defibrillation? Why is he playing this game
at all? But there just wasn't anything I couldfind to even speculate as to what the answer
might be. But then came the April update,and it changed everything. With this update, there
was one more change made to the bathroom once youbeat the game for the first time. A computer
that has been smashed through the mirror with abrain sticking out of it? Checking the monitor
reveals it to be a Koni brand monitor that tellsyou the stats of all your runs. But it also has
a strange invitation to register the computer viaemail. You'd have thought that would have been
registered to the building already, but nope.Instead, we are given an email address. Contact
at volta standardelectronics.com. And this emailaddress actually works. Though it doesn't really
matter what you send it, you'll just get anautomated response back. But that doesn't mean
it's useless. Far from it actually. It says this,Greetings, and thank you for reaching
out to Volta Standard Electronics,the perpetual pioneers of technology. Our Volta
Standard Electronics Helpline is specificallydesigned to help you with any questions you
might have. For example, here's what we foundregarding your query. And then it just spits out
this assortment of letters, numbers, and symbols,only following up with, in case of any new
developments, the Volta Standard ElectronicsHelpline will reach out to you directly. If you
guys have been around for a while, you probablythink you know where this is going. Because yes,
that is Base64. But simply copy pasting it intobase64decode.org isn't gonna get you the full
solution. It turns out, this Base64 code isprotected by a key. Much like you'd find in a
Vigenere cipher. All we have to do now is findthe key. And that comes not from the email, but
from a website. If you take a look again at theemail and think about it for a second, you'll
notice that this wasn't Gmail, or Yahoo, or someonline email hosting platform. It camespecifically from the domain
voltastandardelectronics.com.So I figured, we try putting that domain into
the search bar. And I was rewarded with thisglorious vision of 90s nostalgia. It's
not quite Space Jam levels of 90s glory,but it's definitely up there. On this website,
we learn that Koni not only created the monitorthat we've been using, but also a cell phone
called the Koni Arikson. Obviously, this is aplayoff of the Sony Ericsson, but regardless of
whether or not Sony is actually running some kindof underground Russian roulette ring, Koni does
stand by their word when they say they're designedto help. As part of the April update, the Koni
Arikson was added as a power-up to use duringthe game. Using it calls a mysterious number
that tells you if one specific future shellis blank or live. It's definitely
helping, and it makes their tagline,embrace the future that we see on the website,
very apt. But that's not the only way it helps.At the bottom of the webpage, there is a nice
big red number, which is dead. But that wasn'talways the case. In the early days of the ARG,
this number would play an automated messagefrom Volta's helpline. Initially, this sounds
like any other automated phone message.However, we then get this piece of information.Now we're getting somewhere. This world is
currently on a government-issued lockdown.While we can be seen driving off at the end
of the game if we succeed against the dealer,we clearly aren't going to be able to go far.
Most likely, we're really only able to travelwithin the city, or at most within the country.
This idea of being locked down by a potentiallyauthoritarian government isn't exactly new
territory for this developer either. MikeKlubnika focuses pretty much all of their games
on these dingy looking facilities with peopleeither trying to break out of them, or trying
to take advantage of the system in some way.Some of those games even share direct connections,
with both Carbon Steel and Control Room Alphashowing the same logo in each facility. Mike hasgone on record to say that
his games are connected,though not every connection is going to be
obvious. So it's likely that Buckshot's lockdownis connected to that shared universe too. But
something that is clear is that thanks to thisvoice message, we now have the key for that
email we've been deciphering. That's right,it turns out the thing that got my theorist ears
to prick up are also the words used for the key.The shutdown. Maybe this would give us
the connections we were looking for.But there was still one minor hiccup.
This Base64 code not only used a key,but it was also scrambled using a non-standard
algorithm. To de-scramble it, we needed to usethe same algorithm or website. And despite trying
a bunch of different websites, nobody could figureit out. The answer eventually had to be revealed
to us by the ARG's creator, Rita Radium. Thispointed the community to Gillmeistersoftware.com,
and with that, we could finally read the emailwe got right at the start. They won't ever
forgive me, or will I not forgive myself?I made a wish upon a falling star, and it brought
me nothing but misery. The machine hungers,fed by booming shots and blood and luck. It is
fed constantly. It's chewing, metallic and vile,and it still brings more comfort
than the dance of hell below.This poem offers some pretty obvious parallels to
what we've been experiencing in the game so far.The dance below would be referring to the
nightclub we see below the catwalk as we startthe game. The line about booming shots matches us
shooting each other with shotguns. And the factthe machine is fed by it, as well as blood and
luck, seems to be referencing the dealer himself.It would make a lot of sense for him to be a
machine of some sort, able to survive a shotgunto the face and not needing any kind of
defibrillation to be revived. That phrase,the machine hungers, has also shown up before.
It's how Mike signed off one of his communityupdates. Quote, the machine hungers for
more. Greed everlasting. Mike Klubnika,CR Channel and Volta Standard Electronics. Him
signing off with Volta Standard Electronics,along with that phrase, the machine hungers,
would seem to indicate that Volta is responsible,not just for selling cell phones and computers
to this strange facility, but for the monsterthat's running these backroom roulette games.
Although, the idea that it hungers does seem toimply a lack of control over the situation. Like
they are somehow responsible for bringing themachine to life, but are now unable to keep
it satiated. Could whatever the dealer is beresponsible for the shutdown? Or is it just a
part of something much bigger and much worse?It's all possible, but to find out, I had to
keep digging. And when I did, I found something Iwasn't expecting. Steam cards. If you don't know
what these are, it's pretty much what it says onthe tin. They're just virtual trading cards
that you can get through Steam. Typically,they're associated with specific games, and
you can use them to raise your Steam level,earn cosmetics for your profile, or earn coupons
for DLC. But that's not the case for BuckshotRoulette. Just like it's Game of Roulette,it plays by different rules.
Because these trading cardscontain some in-universe lore, though one of them
is more interesting than the rest. The Burner Phone.If you look closely, on its screen you can find
a binary sequence which decodes to 2 Chronicles26:15, a passage from the Bible. This particular
passage is about a king named Uzziah. Uzziah wasa godly king that saw much success during his
reign. However, because of his achievements,he became proud. And one day, he attempted to
burn incense in the temple, something whichwas reserved only for the priests. He was
essentially saying that he was above thelaw and greater than the holy priests, leading to
God giving him leprosy. The specific verse we'regiven, verse 15, comes from just before
Uzziah's fall. And it says, quote,In Jerusalem, he made devices invented for use
on the towers, and on the corner defenses sothe soldiers could shoot arrows and hurl large
stones from the walls. His fame spread far andwide, for he was greatly helped,until he became powerful. We're
being told about a man in authoritywho was building something to defend his nation.
A man who became prideful of these achievements,and in doing so, fell from grace and was cursed
because of it. It matches quite nicely with thepoem we've been given. They won't ever forgive
me, or will I not forgive myself? I made a wishupon a falling star, and it brought me nothing but
misery. Again, it's a story about someone doingsomething they felt was good, but for it to
eventually backfire on them. However, this isn'tthe only biblical reference we get. There's
actually one other moment that you can find inthe second round of Buckshot Roulette. At the
start of the game, you sign a liability waiver.Yeah, go figure. If Volta is behind the machine
that hungers for death, good to know that they'veprotected their own butts. Other kind of butt,
in round two we come across a different liabilitywaiver, one that has already been signed by
someone else, covered in blood, showing thatthat person has died. And it is signed by
someone, I don't know, fairly important,God. That's right, the big G man himself. God
has not only played this game, but lost it too.Mike himself has said that all hell broke loose
when God lost the game, which we can see when wedie in the game ourselves. You end up at the
pearly gates, though they're a little morespiky than I remember from Sunday school. That
being said, if we consider this alongside theBible verse about Uzziah, it makes me think that
we may not be talking about a literal God here.In that quote from Mike about hell breaking
loose, he also describes God as just your averagecreator of the universe type of guy. What if God
in this instance isn't actually the biblical God,but instead a man who considers himself to be
God? A man who, much like Uzziah, built a greatand prosperous world, and so began to become
prideful, thinking himself greater than everyoneelse, a God amongst men. But also like Uzziah,
this would lead to his eventual downfall. Whentaking things into his own hands, our poem
writer saw everything around him collapse,all because of his pride and hubris. The
question is, who is this mysterious writer,and what is it he did to cause this downfall?
This is where Mike's other games come into play.After selling 1 million copies of Buckshot
Roulette, which is really commendable by the way,we got a new trailer for the game, and in just
a few frames, we saw some words pop on screen.Remember August 5th, 1998. According to the phone
powerup, this game takes place on August 21st,1998, which not only explains the old look of
all the technology, but that whatever caused theshutdown, it only happened 16 days prior to the
events of the game. I did search for this dateonline, but I just couldn't find anything of
specific interest. That was, until I went backthrough Mike's catalog of games. Because this
date has shown up in at least one of them before.In the game Carbon Steel, we are conducting
unethical experiments on creatures livingdeep underground and collecting data from them.
After the very first day, we have a nightmareabout these fleshy creatures covered in ice
breaking up into our little chamber. And astime goes on, the creatures we begin pulling out
are more and more violent. At the end of the game,we blow up our lab in order to escape, but in
doing so, we totally destroy the containment tubethat we've been using to retrieve and analyse
these creatures. We may now be free, but so iswhatever was down there. We also learn from the
emails we get in the game that this lab hasn'tbeen used in decades. So our first day on the
job was the day that something changed. The daythis facility came online and began digging around
the depths of the earth for creatures to analyse.And do you want to hazard a guess as to when
our first day on the job was? Yep, August 5th,1998. I don't think that our player character is
the one writing this poem. No, no, no. Instead,I think it is whoever was in charge of this
operation that was willing to torture thesecreatures in the name of science. That is what
led our character to look for freedom and in turncause the shutdown. These monsters that we've
angered are now free to take revenge on theplanet. And it all began on August 5th, 1998.
Finally, it felt like we were getting somewherewith this game's lore. But sadly, this is where
our journey hits a bit of a roadblock. If you goback to the site, you'll find a big yellow star
next to the phone. If you click it, it brings youto a secret login page. Perfect. We just need
to find the password. Well, that's kind of theproblem. Nobody can figure out what the password
is. According to the creators, we have all theclues we need to solve the password. And that 1
million download trailer we got? Yeah, that wassupposed to try and give us a hint. But despite
all efforts, analyzing this thing top to bottom,we still can't really figure out what it is. For
example, in that trailer, there was also a secretcaption that read cupio dissolvi. It's Latin for
I want to dissolve and refers to the Christiandesire to leave life and join Christ in heaven.
But over time, the meaning has evolved to alsoinvolve the general desire for one's own death.
Feels apt for a game about roulette, but whetherthat means anything for the password puzzle
is unclear. We also have references to otherreligious ideas. In the May update, Mike ended his
post with a single V and a bunch of blank spacesinstead of his usual sign off. When the game
got 2 million downloads, another very impressiveachievement, Mike posted a different signature
that looked like this. If we add the V from thefirst signature and then use a basic Caesar
cipher, we can find the phrase Taci MaledettoLupo, a line from Dante's Inferno that translates
to silence a cursed wolf. This particular line isknown as the Volta of the
first sonnet. As in Voltastandard electronics? In Italian, Volta meansturn and in Italian poetry, it is usually the
ninth line of a 14 line sonnet, in which thereis a large shift in the tone or subject. In the
official Discord, someone suggested that the poemfound in the ARG email has nine lines,just like Dante's Nine Circles
of Hell, to which Rita repliedsmart kitten. Though this post has been removed,
so it's hard to say if it's still relevant orwhether things got changed. Finally, there's the
phone, because it always comes back to the phone.I didn't mention this earlier, but you may have
noticed that this phone's keys aren't exactlystandard. The voicemail logo is a sideways
ampersand, the number 9 contains a capitalLOL instead of WXYZ. There's also an extra line
of buttons that contains letters like WTF. Huh.And cat. Yeah, at this point, I'd agree with
that sentiment. I am 100%... I have triedso many different words translating it in through
these keys to try and find the password. Mytheorist senses are screaming at me that the
answer is in there. Otherwise, it's just weirdthat they've been staring us in the face the
whole time and yet don't do anything. But now,I'm out of options, and it looks like the rest of
the community is too. And they've been way moreruthless than I have. They have tried over 1,000
passwords to try and get into this site. They'vetried listing the Nine Circles of Hell all
together, with spaces, with underscores, in everypossible combination. Nothing. They've tried
taking lines from Dante's Inferno, both in Latinand in English. Nothing. They've even tried typing
all of these phrases using the numbers in thephone like I did, and they're still coming up
empty. And so, this is where I need your help.So far, we know we're looking at a story of
someone who, in falling victim to their ownpride and ambition, doomed humanity by
reactivating an abandoned lab that wasdesigned to bring monsters from deep within
the earth up to the surface for testing.Sadly, not everyone agreed, and their
escape led to these monsters roaming free,causing a government-issued lockdown, where
underground roulette rings and dance clubs nowthrive as people desperately seek some kind of
excitement or financial reward in this brokenworld. I wouldn't be surprised if there's more
connections to Mike's other games as well.The other side is about someone trying to
break out of a giant government shelter,only to realise that they were right and there
are monsters out there. That monster is verymuch spider-like, and in Control Room Alpha and
Core, we also encounter spider-like monsters,with Core also showing us a mechanical heart
in a facility. A machine that hungers, maybe?And those spider monsters from Core also look
awfully familiar to a certain dealer we know.That's all pure speculation on my part, but Mike
has said these games are very carefully connected,and so, with this ARG showing us a connection
between Buckshot Roulette and Carbon Steel,I could easily see whatever is behind that
password lock, revealing to us more about thisconnected universe. But if we don't work together
to solve it, we may never truly know what's goingon in this world. So, if you'd like to join me
in solving this thing, you can head down to thedescription where I've left a link to the website
made by the community to track what's been goingon. They have done an incredible job over there,not just enlisting over
1000 passwords that they'vealready tried, but also breaking down this ARG
way more than I ever could. Thanks to some membersof their community, we've even managed to find
some rules about how this password works, likethat it should be 4-20 characters long, not use
any special characters, mostly, and that it iscase-sensitive. I would love for us, the theorist
community, to rally behind the awesome work beingdone by these guys. They have worked so hard
to try and get to the bottom of this, and weneed answers. But I'm sure that with all our
powers combined, we will be able to solve this ARGand its cryptic lore. So, make sure you are
subscribed if you're not already, because youcan bet your bottom dollar that when we do solve
this thing, I'll be covering it right here to helpend the story once and for all. But in the
meantime, remember, that's just a theory. Agame theory. Thanks for watching. And if solving
this website doesn't keep you busy, you can alwayscheck out our video on all the secrets hiding
within the website of Welcome Home.

Kai, but your friend is right.Though it's not for the reasons you might think.Hello internet!Welcome to Game Theory, the show that knows
that gaming is a marathon, not a sprint.And that is more true than ever, because
marathon streams are one of the biggest mattersin streaming right now.You know the ones I'm talking about, the
I'm not ending stream until I do X, likeTimTheTatman's not ending stream until I
derank in Rainbow Six, or TBNRFrag's streaminguntil I hit Unreal rank in Fortnite.Whether it's the sheer novelty of these
continuous streams, or the desire to be thereand spam "I was here" in chat when it all ends,
something about these kinds of streams capturesour attention.And the newest game to be the subject ofthese marathon streams is of
course, the long-anticipatedDLC for Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree.And it is hard.So hard in fact, that FromSoftware have actually
come out with a patch to make it a tiny biteasier.And this is from the company that
is known for making hard games.I guess you could call this DLC
the Dark Souls of Souls-like games.It's like the Ouroboros eating its own tail.Even so, when streamer Kai Cenat announced
that he was going to be doing a marathon ofthe new DLC, people were hyped.And the marathon ended up being quite a ride.He laughed, he cried, he raged.In fact, things got so rough for Kai, that he
had to bring in an actual licensed therapistto help calm him down.Which got me thinking, was there
something he could have done differently?Sure, watching Kai bash his head against a
wall was no doubt entertaining, and what hedid was certainly a massive achievement.But I can't help but feel like there were
some efficiencies he let go to waste.The only other person who attempted to marathon
this DLC, at least at the time of writing,was Ludwig.But he did it in 40 hours less.What was he doing differently that allowed
him to lessen his time in the self-imposedprison?You might think it's all to do with in-game
strategy, or their builds, or their previousexperience.But that's not very Theorist.Instead, I'm talking about
something much less subjective.Science.Science is more than just getting good, after all.Your environment, your sleep, your diet, they can
all affect things like your mood, concentrationand reaction times.All things that are essential
for a game like this.So was there science Kai could have used in
order to save himself hours of heartache?Well just like any good Elden Ring player,
I too am willing to sink tens of hours intomindlessly grinding away at a task.So grab your enchanted greatswords and data
charts, because I've got the strats to helpKai, other streamers, and even you fully
optimize whatever gaming marathon lies ahead.So first things first, exactly what data
am I collecting and how am I doing it?Well, I ended up watching all the nearly 100
hours Kai streamed, and made notes of anythinghe was doing outside of the game.Things like when he ate, when he took breaks,
what his mental state was, all in order tosee whether there was any science that could
have been applied to lead to a faster time.I also watched all of Ludwig's 57 hours of
stream, to see if he somehow subconsciouslydid follow the science and whether that could
have been the reason for his faster time.However, it became very clear that this
was going to be a really tough comparison.Elden Ring is an open world game, there is a
ton of optional places to explore, so despiteputting in the hours, I needed to limit the
scope slightly in order to get a fair comparison.So I decided to focus on a
very specific part of the run.The DLC's final boss, Radahn.Radahn is the primary reason this DLC is so tough.Most people who play the DLC spend half of
their time on this guy alone, and Kai andLudwig were no exception.Plus, both Kai and Ludwig reached Radahn at
around the same point in their run, roughly31 hours in, so it meant they were going
in on a basically even playing field.So with that out of the way,
let's dive into the data.When I initially saw these streams announced,
the thing I was worried most about was theamount of sleep they'd actually be getting.I personally love my sleep, but when you've
dedicated yourself to streaming until youbeat a particular game, I could imagine streamers
forgoing adequate sleep time in order to makefurther progress.Now, I don't think I need to tell you all
that sleep is very important for your brain.Virtually all research shows that your brain
will stop working at its full potential ifyou go without sleep.Sleep deprivation, even just a tiny amount,
can lead to slower reaction times, smallerattention spans, reduced ability
to adapt, and impaired judgement.All things that are critical for
accomplishing difficult tasks.Oh, that's why my GT Live
live performance was so poor.I was just jet lagged, and nothing
to do with my lack of art skills.So how much sleep were these guys getting?Ludwig only slept once in his 26 hour run
against Radahn, and it was for roughly 7 hours.Hard to say for sure because it's stream
cut out, but providing he did go to bed whenhe said he did, and didn't spend too much
time dilly dallying before getting back onstream, he would have been in good shape.Doctors recommend 7-9 hours of sleep in order
to avoid the effects of sleep deprivation.So Ludwig is just skirting on that line.Kai however, didn't follow that advice.He definitely laid in bed for 8 hours each
time he slept, which he did 3 times acrossthe Radahn section of his stream.But if you actually watched Kai sleep, which
is creepier now that I'm saying it out loud,but it's for science, I
promise, my job is so weird.But if you did, and you subtract the time that
he spent shifting around to get comfortableor playing on his phone, then you'd realise
he only slept for just shy of 6 and a halfhours on the first night, and only
5 and a half hours on the next two.He is getting way less sleep than is required
to fight off sleep deprivation, which is likelywhat led to some of his worst reaction times.Sleep is also when your brain converts short
term memories you've acquired throughoutthe day, and turns them into long term memories.But that rest, all that muscle memory you've
been picking up by playing the game over andover and over again, it's just not going
to make its way into long term memory, andso by the time you wake up, your muscles
aren't going to remember how to do it properly.So if you want to optimize your streaming
marathon with better reaction times, attentionspans and building muscle memory, rule
number 1 is get the full 7-9 hours of sleep.However, it's not like Kai was just
grinding during every waking moment.He did slow down and take some regular breaks.In fact, from the moment he started his attempts
against Rodan, I counted that Kai took about43 breaks over his 44 waking
hours, roughly 1 break per hour.These breaks then averaged out at about 18
minutes in length, and ranged from checkinghis phone, to eating, to watching other streamers.According to research, Kai absolutely nailed
the frequency and length of breaks to maximizeproductivity.One study found that the most productive workers
would, on average, work continuously for around52 minutes before taking a 17 minute break,
which is shockingly close to what Kai averaged.This is important because other research has
shown that those who take breaks ultimatelyend up being more focused, less
stressed, and make better decisions.In contrast, Ludwig only took 15 breaks over
his 27 waking hours, with the average lengthbeing just 7 minutes per break, which is way
below what is recommended to be productive.So why did it take Kai so much longer?Because it's not all about the length or
frequency of breaks, it's about the quality.Not all breaks are made equal.What you do during those breaks can often
make just as much of a difference, if notmore, than how often you take them.For example, getting up and moving is
significantly better for your brain's function.And this isn't just true for those
who spend their days in cubicles.We also have data on the effects
of breaks on gamers specifically.New York Tech Center for Esports Medicine, a
center I cannot believe exists, what a worldwe live in, they looked at the effect that a
walking break can have on a gamer's performance.They took 21 gamers and had them play a
video game continuously for about 2 hours.At the 1 hour mark, the gamers were asked to
either take no break, lay down for 6 minutes,or walk around for 6 minutes.Those who took the walking break showed both
significantly better reaction and planningtimes than even those who had the rest break.One of the participants summed
up the benefits perfectly, quote,The walking break definitely has the
best impact on gaming performance.It helps you to clear your mind
while doing something physical.Even if you're walking slowly, it helps
you calm down and forget the high pressurefrom the gaming environment.Your brain isn't going overboard anymore.And Ludwig actually did do this, not every time,
but he did get up and walk around occasionally,which likely added to his success.If Kai had done the same, then he might have
just been able to walk free from his streamsfaster than he would have expected.Instead, he did something that research has
shown to be the worst kind of break, browsingsocial media.During several of his breaks, Kai would whip
out his phone to check Twitter or TikTok.He even slipped in a couple of phone
looks between his attempts against Radahn.Taking breaks to look at your phone only serves
to mess with your brain and make you lessproductive.A study in the Journal of Behavioral Addictions
found that participants who took a break tocheck their phone took 19% longer to complete
their assigned tasks and finished 22% lesswork than those who didn't check their phone.On top of that, those who checked their phones
did significantly worse than even those whotook a break on their computer, which was the
approach Ludwig took, watching other streamerson his computer.All in all, when it comes to breaks, even
though Kai took breaks more frequently andfor longer, that advantage was completely
washed away by how he spent his break time.Therefore, if you are completing some sort
of long-term task, make sure you are takingbreaks every hour and also use this time to
get up, move those legs and please leave thebox of distractions as far
away from you as possible.Stepping away from breaks, while it is important
to fuel your brain with decent rest, it'salso important to fuel it with literal fuel.73% of your brain is made up of water, so
staying fully hydrated is super importantto keeping your wits about you.And I know it sounds cliche, everyone and
their grandmother tells you to drink morewater, but there's actually
a very good reason for that.Drinking more water has been shown to improve
your cognitive function, reaction times andyour mood, something that
Kai clearly needed improved.Meanwhile, not drinking water has been shown
to inhibit your memory, your alertness andyour focus.And these effects aren't just
limited to severe dehydration either.Being just 2% dehydrated can impair your
performance in a whole range of mental tasks.Now, to be clear, both streamers could have
used a little bit more fluid in their diet.However, Ludwig was the only
one drinking outside of meals.Specifically, he was drinking from
this glass bottle with a yellow label.Doing a bit of online digging, I found that
this was a bottle of Topo Chico mineral water,so kudos there, you did do something right Ludwig.Meanwhile, the only drink I saw Kai reaching
for was Bang Energy Drink, which yes, haswater in it, but it also contains
other ingredients like caffeine,which is great for improvingyour reaction time and cognitive performance
in the short term, but it can also make youjittery.So while playing a game that requires absolute
precision and perfect timing like Elden Ring,that may not be the greatest
side effect to put up with.And that's not the only downside.Caffeine is also what is known as a diuretic.Basically, it means you pee more.Therefore, you are eliminating the water from
your body much quicker, losing all of thebenefit the water in that drink provides.So while in the short term, a caffeinated
beverage might help push you through the lastcouple of hours of a shift, in the end, it
will make you jittery and will ultimatelylead you to losing water faster.Instead, you can get nearly all the cognitive
benefits with none of the downsides just bydrinking classic H2O when you're thirsty.Now, I spent a lot of time going into the
nitty gritty of the different approaches Kaiand Ludwig have taken throughout their streams,
but if you've watched any of the streamsfor yourselves, you'll probably know there
was one difference that was a little easierto spot.A break?I don't need one.No!I'm not doing this one, bro.I'm done.I'm done.Leave me the **** alone!Leave me alone!No!No!No!No!No!No!No!No!No!No!No!No!No!No!No!No!But while you may be losing the game, losing
your cool doesn't do your brain any favors.Anger, especially stress-related anger, activates
the emotional parts of your brain like theAmygdala, and triggers that fight-or-flight
response which in turn limits our abilityto think.And in the case of Kai, if the source of your
anger is the thing you must overcome in orderto free yourself, that ends up
creating a pretty vicious cycle.He plays, gets angry, it limits his brain's
ability to think clearly which leads to himplaying worse, meaning he loses again, and
the next thing you know you're talking toa therapist with a PlayStation
controller in your hand.But you might be thinking, Kai is letting
out his anger, isn't that better than keepingit bottled up?Well, as it turns out, the more you vent
your anger, the angrier you actually become.Brad Bushman, a senior researcher and professor
from Ohio State University, said that ventinganger might sound like a good idea, but there's
not a shred of scientific evidence to supportcatharsis theory, i.e. the idea
of getting it off your chest.He goes on to say it's really a battle because
angry people want to vent, but our researchshows that any good feeling we get from
venting actually reinforces aggression.Basically, by letting out your aggression,
you get that sense of catharsis and positiverelease in the moment, but that teaches your
brain to get angry again in order to receivethat same positive feeling.On the flip side, bottling up your anger
and never addressing it can be just as bad.Adding on to anger leads to a build-up
of the stress hormone cortisol.This stress hormone can lead to problems with
attention, decreased mental processing, ormuddled thinking.Once again, all the things we're trying to avoid.So that leaves the question, what is the
healthy way to overcome inevitable anger?The answer is doing exactly
what Ludwig did, calming down.Sophie Chavek, a post-doctoral fellow at the
Virginia Commonwealth University, noticedthe rise of things like rage rooms, places
where people are encouraged to vent theirfrustrations for a nominal fee.So she decided to do a meta-analysis of over
150 studies on over 10,000 participants tofind the best ways to cope with anger.A theorist after my own heart.Look at all those numbers!But what she found is that the best thing
you can do is to carry out activities thatlower your arousal levels, not give in to them.Activities like running, using a punching
bag, and cycling were much less effectiveat controlling anger than activities meant
to decrease arousal, like deep breathing andmeditation.The fact that Kai is so quick to let out his
frustration is wiring his brain to remainon high alert, and he's never
getting a chance to truly rest.That in turn leads to decreased cognitive
function, prolonging his run, which makeshim angrier.This is why Kai's therapist repeatedly tried
to get him to calm down and breathe, to littlesuccess.I HATE THIS GAME!But when Ludwig felt like he was getting heated,
he took a 5 minute break where he walked awayfrom the computer, getting his brain out
of high alert and allowing him to re-centreand focus.So if you end up being faced with a challenge,
be it Elden Ring, or work, or just somethingthat gets your blood boiling, instead of letting
it all out, use techniques that can help calmyou down, like deep breathing, walking, or
listening to lo-fi like the one you're hearingright now.This is actually from our new project, Lo-Fi.I've been listening to it while I've been
writing this episode, and despite watchingall of the rage in front of me, I
cannot tell you how much calmer I feel.You can listen to it right now for free over on
Spotify, there will be a link in the description.Take a listen, and I'm sure that next time
you're faced with a challenge, you willbe calmer and ready to take on anything.Maybe I should send this playlist to Kai for
his next stream, because throughout this one,Kai made several choices in the way he treated
his brain that almost guaranteed that he'dnever be able to beat this DLC.You can even see it when you
plot Kai's attempts on a graph.That's right, I went back and watched the
stream again and counted the amount of timeshe died, pausing each time he did die to
measure what percentage of Radahn's HP hegot through.And if you take a look, you'll see he didn't
improve much at all over the course of hisrun at Radahn.In fact, if you look at just the first full
day of attempts at the big guy, Kai somehowgot worse as the day went on.But spoiler alert, despite all his disadvantages,
he does eventually conquer his demons andslay Radahn.The question is, what changed?Well, if you pay close attention to the graph,
you'll notice that around attempt 360, somethingshifts.Suddenly, there is a pretty big spike in Kai's
performance, a spike that he was able to sustainand then build upon leading to
him eventually defeating Radahn.So I went back to my notes to see what was
happening, and I noticed Kai did somethingthat I wasn't expecting.He listened.After 79 hours of streaming, 48 of which were
on this boss alone, he slowly started listeningto the advice his chat was offering.With their help, he developed a build and
strategy that allowed him to consistentlyget through the first phase of
the fight with very little effort.When that worked, Kai suddenly
was on the upward swing.Just 20 attempts later, he got through
half of Radahn's health for the first time.20 attempts after that, Kai gets a personal
best, getting through two thirds of his health.This isn't just down to chat
having six strats either.Asking for help required Kai to put his trust
in someone other than himself, and sciencehas proven that when we do that,
something interesting happens.When our trust is paid off, our brains release
a chemical called oxytocin, otherwise knownas the love hormone.Now, I'm not saying that Kai was suddenly
in love with his chat, though I suppose youcould argue that, but oxytocin
has other very important uses.Specifically, it plays a role in the process
of neurogenesis, the creation of new neuronsand neuropathways, allowing him to
find new techniques and remember them.Why?Because oxytocin has also been shown to
help protect our hippocampus from stress.The hippocampus is where long-term memories
live in our brains, and so by accepting helpfrom chat and from a licensed therapist, then
having it pay off, he was able to regain someof what he'd been losing from his lack of sleep.The stress of his failed runs weren't being
stored in long-term memory, and instead, hewas just able to take what he'd learned
and apply it, creating new neuropathways inhis brain, allowing him to get better and
better, until eventually, after 99 hours ofstruggle and over 1000 deaths, he finally did it.Yes!Yes!Yes!It's over!He didn't sleep enough, he didn't take
the right kind of breaks, he didn't drinkhis water, and he couldn't keep his cool,
but he did know when to put his pride asideand accept help when the chips were down.Who knows, he might still be fighting Radahn
today if he hadn't looked to others forhelp.And I guess that's my final piece of advice
to Kai or Ludwig or to anyone who decidesto lock themselves in a room until they have
to beat whatever task it is they choose.If you want to optimize your marathon, the
best thing you can do is realise that whileyou may be stuck in a room, there are plenty
of people around you who aren't, and theyare there to help you.Because let's be honest, none of
us can truly do anything alone.But there you have it theorists, my 5 step
guide to optimizing marathon streaming orwork tasks or homework or anything that requires
you to stay locked in a room for multipledays.Make sure you get your 7-9 hours of
actual sleep, not just time in bed.Take regular breaks and when you do, don't
spend it on your phone or social media.Remember to drink plenty of water with
no additives, especially caffeine.When things get tough, keep your cool
and find ways to manage your stress.Get up, go for a walk around the room.And finally, if things do seem impossible,
don't be ashamed to ask for help.And Kai, if you're watching, a huge
congratulations on your victory.You not only made something
entertaining, but inspiring.You inspired Ludwig, you inspired me to make
this episode, and in return, I hope that I'veinspired you, so that the next time you decide
to marathon stream, which might actually beright now if you haven't been Bloodborne
yet, regardless, you'll be fully equippedto tackle any challenge that comes your way.Just next time, maybe stay off your phone
and please, for the love of Malenia, drinksome water.But hey, that's just a theory, a game theory.Thanks for watching.And if Elden Ring is too much of a challenge
for you, or you're just new to gaming ingeneral, why not check out our
10-step guide on learning video games.Happy gaming, theorists!Lacey Games is one of the most disturbing
franchises we've ever covered. This isnormally where I put in a joke or a light-hearted
comment, but today is not the day for that. Whatinitially appears as a bright and colourful set
of flash games for young girls, quickly revealsa dark story of trauma,along with the very sad and very real
issues that can cause it. This theoryis not for the faint of heart, but if you are
willing to keep going, there's a fascinatingstory waiting for you. You have been warned.
Hello Internet! Welcome to Game Theory,the show that really misses good old-fashioned
flash games. Nothing can scratch that nostalgicitch, quite like going back through Newgrounds
and finding that game you used to play almost20 years ago. But clearly I'm not the only
one feeling nostalgic for this era of gaming,because recently a new YouTube series has popped
up from the YouTuber Ghosttundra about an oldflash series that no one has heard of. Lacey
Games. The reason no one has heard of it? Well,because it never really existed. Yeah, this
is a Petscop situation, where we follow thelet's plays of a user as they document an old
series of flash games from their childhood.Except, these aren't real games. Despite what
you may have seen YouTubers playing online,the only true versions that exist are on Ghost
Tundra's channel as part of this series. Whyare we talking about a YouTube series here on
Game Theory rather than Film Theory? Maybe ifLee wasn't so busy stealing my stuff, then
I wouldn't have to steal this from him.Oh what's that? I couldn't hear you over
all of these great video game movies.This series is also about games, whether they're
real or not, so it does feel like it fits hereon Game Theory. Though, as you can probably
guess, not all is as it seems. Initially,it's just a series of simulator games that would
belong on any flash website. Things like dress-upsims, cooking sims, pet grooming sims, and makeup
sims. But, when the video's uploader digs aroundthe Lacey Games site,they discover some disturbing secrets
hidden within these seemingly innocentgames. Creepy characters hiding in darkness,
cryptic messages flashing between frames,and disturbing visuals of Lacey taking her own
life. What the heck is going on with this gamedesigned for kids? Is this some weird demonic
spirit possessing the game? Or a video gamecharacter come to life? No. In fact, the weirdest
part of all of this is this is exactly how thedeveloper intended these games to be. They made
these games as a warning. So, let's turn ourclocks back to 2009, theorists, because we are
going to piece together all the hidden clues tofigure out what the heck is happening inside Lacey
Games, and whether there is anything we can do tosave both Lacey and its developer. The seriesbegins with the game Lacey's
Wardrobe, which starts as awholesome dress-up sim where the player prepares
Lacey for her cute date, trying on differentcombinations of tops and shoes. Honestly, I'm
kind of digging these looks, they're the perfectlevel of 2000s adorable. Though it doesn't take
long for these things to take an unsettling turn.As the player completes outfits for Lacey, a
figure stalking her in the distance gets closer,and closer, and closer. He leaves threatening
voicemails, sends her gory presents, andultimately gets hold of her. Now, normally at this
point you'd expect that the character is trappedin a basement somewhere and that you have to
escape or something, but not Lacey. The resultshere are much darker. Here, she is dismembered and
then eaten. Yeah, I told you the series was dark,and if that was too much for you, it's only
gonna get worse from here. So, this is your finalwarning. After this point, we are going to be
getting into some very real and very disturbingstuff. I urge you to proceed with caution. There
is no shame in backing out now, but if you havechosen to stay, let's move on to the next
installment, Lacey's Diner. This is a game aboutLacey running a restaurant. Normally, everything
is fine. You just put the ingredients into a bowland serve your creations to your customers. But
the video's poster informs us that there's asecret ending, and in it, Lacey's business begins
to fail. She does not handle this career failurewell, and ends up creating the most
advertiser-unfriendly recipes you could imagine,using ingredients like cockroaches, broken glass,
cigarette butts. Not exactly what you'd expectfrom a kid's game. However, during this segment,
it becomes clear that the business failing isn'tactually the root of this psychological break.
It comes from her past trauma. We get severalflash frames of disturbing poetry, with
one of the less graphic lines reading,When he looked down, he saw my little
bruised cheeks smiling back at him,the exact size of his sweaty palms. The rest
of the lines aren't strictly safe for YouTube,but that first line gives us all we really need
to know. Lacey was being abused. Each unsavoryingredient Lacey puts into her final meal ties
into what she went through. The cockroaches thatlined her ceiling, the broken glass she was hurt
with, and a bag of drugs that she was forced totake. All of this is telling
us about Lacey's backstory.She was traumatized by those experiences,and now, every wrong ingredient, every small
setback, every mistake, they bring all of thattrauma back to the surface, causing the games to
literally fall apart at the seams and reveal thebroken little girl that lies beneath. This then
continues in the third installment, Lacey's PetShop. As usual, it starts out like a classic
kid's game where Lacey grooms pets, washing them,cutting their hair, but the requests get more
and more extreme, asking her to stretch out theirnecks or cut off their limbs. After she causes
too many atrocities, it devolves even furtherinto a nightmarish point-and-click adventure
game, and it's here where we learn the truth aboutLacey's abuse. As you go through this new section,
text appears in the bottom right corner that says,Uncle, have you seen Puddles anywhere? I
can't find her. And she goes on to say,Stop laughing! Later on we discover that Puddles
was Lacey's dog, but only as she mourns for thedeath of her sweet little angel. It seems
pretty clear that her uncle was laughing,because he knew exactly where Puddles
was. He was the one who killed Puddles.She follows this up later with another poem,
quote, For years he was barking up the wrong tree,worried about his sins becoming too visible on
my skin. For this poem to immediately followthe lamenting of her dog, the one her uncle
killed, suggests that wasn't all that he wasresponsible for. He was also responsible
for her horrid living conditions, her pain,and her suffering. He was Lacey's abuser.
It is at this point, however, that we beginto see something shift. While she mourns her dog,she defiantly states, You
can hurt me all you like,but weren't allowed to take it away from me. I
will let you rot. Her dog being killed was thefinal straw, causing something to snap inside
Lacey. And when she enters the next room,she tells us this, And when he turned his
back, I was the dog that bit his neck.Then, suddenly, she wakes up, back in the world
of sunshine and rainbows. It was all just anightmare, except there's a corpse peering out
from under her bed. Lacey finally took revenge onthe man who caused her so much pain, killing him
in a burst of rage, leaving his corpse to rotbeneath her. However, at the end of this video,
there's one final detail that changes everythingwe've seen so far. At the beginning and end of the
video, we hear audio recordings from a charactercalled Grace Asop. She is one of the founders
of LaceyGames.com. But during her final recording,we hear her say this, Now, if you've not been
going through this series frame by frame likeI have, that likely doesn't mean anything to you.
But, we saw this name appear during Lacey's diner.In the disturbing ingredients section, once
you place the drugs into the mixing bowl,the game cuts to an image of a drug
fact sheet, and on it is Rocio's name.In the next video, titled The Disturbing Rabbit
Hole of LaceyGames.com, we hear an interviewbetween Grace and a new character, Charlie, the
person who has been uploading these let's plays.Grace informs us that while she was in charge
of managing the website, Rocio was the game'sdesigner, and was responsible for inserting all
the concerning content. Her inserting her ownname like this on something so realistic and
horrifying can only really mean one thing.The poem of abuse, these ingredients, these aren't
from Lacey's backstory. They're from Rocio's.In Pet Shop, we see more confirmation of this,
with the video cutting to real footage fromRocio's perspective, and it follows the events
we saw Lacey describing about killing her uncle.Despite the sunshine and rainbows,
the darkness didn't go away.Quote, It's been days, but I just can't leave.
He's still under the bed. He'll look at me.Rocio was lying in bed for days after she killed
him, with his corpse just lying underneath her.She was too paralyzed by his influence, even
after his death, to allow herself to leave.This inaction matches a scene earlier in
Pet Shop, where Lacey crawls into a cage,knowing it's bad for her, but
feeling comfort in its familiarity.All Rocio knew was abuse. It's why it took
the death of Puddles to break free from it,and took her a while to build the confidence
to leave that part of her life behind.It's here that the live-action Rocio dreams
of her future in cartoony thought bubbles.It's here, when Rocio sits in bed with her uncle
dead beneath her, that the idea of Lacey was born.A happy girl with dreams and aspirations. One
who could do things she was never allowed to do,like go shopping or buy CDs of her favorite
songs. This is why Ghost Hunter used mixedmediums in this scene, setting up
a juxtaposition between the grim,unlit reality of Rocio, and
the bright future of Lacey.But if Rocio went on to create Lacey Games
to play out her dreams, to be the perfect,bright and happy character, unburdened by
her past trauma, how, and more importantly,why, did they turn into the disturbing
messes that we've been seeing?Charlie even makes the comment that the
website isn't the same as she remembers,which tells me that these games
may not have always been like this,that they likely started off as good and
wholesome to reflect the ideal world Rociowanted to live in, only for something to
bring her crashing back down to reality.And, thanks to that final video, we
know exactly what that something was.We're told by Grace during the Rabbit Hole video
that the site was getting hate mail from parentswho thought that one of the characters, Lacey's
tomboy skater friend Jay, was a bad influenceon their daughters. Ah, good to see angry
hate comments were still a thing back in 2009.And just as ridiculous as ever.
Though Rocio did what I'm suremany YouTubers wished they could do,
she replied with a snarky comment.Careful what you wish for. She did
then comply with their requests,but in a more malicious way than they'd expected.In this video, we are shown two games, Jay's
Skating Game and Lacey's Makeup Parlor.Jay's Skater Game is a classic flash skater game
where you jump from building to building on askateboard, though it ends with Jay whizzing
off a building and falling into a pit of spikes.Jay wasn't just being removed,
she was being killed off.Which I don't think is what the parents had in
mind, nor were they expecting what happened next.In Lacey's Makeup Parlor, Lacey does the
makeup for several women with their eyes shut,but their faces start to sag,
eyes open with uneasy stares,one client even has a maggot
crawl across her face.Then, Jay's mutilated body suddenly appears,revealing that Lacey isn't your average
beautician, but a mortuary cosmetologist,applying lipstick to her friend's corpse while
having a mental breakdown as she processes thedeath. From the website, it is clear that a huge
part of Lacey Games' identity was the friendshipbetween Lacey, Maisie and Jay. With Lacey being
a manifestation of Rocio's hopes and dreams,it stands to reason that strong friendships
were a core desire of Rocio's as well.Killing off her perfect friend was heartbreaking,
but what was worse was that whenever there wasconflict on the site, her friend Grace played
the victim and placed all of the blame on Rocio,saying horrible things about her and eventually
abandoning the project altogether. Once again,this perfect world Rocio had dreamed up wasn't
coming true, and so she took a different approach.In the audio recordings from Grace at the start
of the Pet Shop episode, we see an About Us pagethat reveal that Rocio and Grace started this
site together as, quote, a safe space for kidsto play. I mean, sure, if you call a website full
of death, abuse and cannibal jump scares a safespace, then mission accomplished. Joking aside,
I actually think that despite the changes Rociomade, she believes this statement to be completely
accurate. When Lacey finds a mirror in Pet Shop,we see this character appear. The mirrorshows this as a reflection of
Lacey, the real Lacey, Rocio,and she's breaking the fourth wall, speaking
directly to the children playing her game.She goes on to say, I made lots of games for you,
but with none of those lies. This isn't the firsttime lies has been mentioned in the series either.
During Lacey's diner, one of the many flash framesreveals a poem like you'd expect, although this
one isn't about her uncle. Instead, it reads,They used to teach kids such perverse, little,
bizarre lies that they passed as truth.That is a bit of a mysterious statement.
However, within the context of Lacey's diner,it makes perfect sense. To get this poem,
Charlie had to go down the hidden bad route,which leads to Lacey's business failing. The
themes of this bad ending are all about theweight of failure and the inability to
handle the pressure required to succeed.Contrast this with the good ending, or any
traditional children's media for that matter.They don't have realistic depictions of failure.
Is your dream to run a successful diner? Well,your dreams are achievable with a few easy
clicks of a mouse. Charlie even notes that,to unlock this hidden ending, you have to run down
a timer that's longer than anyone would need forthis simple task. The threat of failure is more
of a vague illusion to make a child's inevitablevictory all the more sweeter. This is what Rocio
meant about Lacey Games being a safe space.The lies Rocio is taking issue with here are
the sugar-coated messages children are told.Morals that say life is easy if you follow
your dreams, that good people prevail and thateverything will be okay in the end. These
are the lies she was taught growing up.But reality proved it all to be false. And so,
she wouldn't sugarcoat things. She would tellit like it is in order to protect other
little girls from going through what she did.Jay's Skating Game is about how recklessness
can spin out of control and lead to fatality.Pet Shop is about the fragile morality of pets
and how it's selfish to treat them as accessories.Makeup Parlour is about the expectation for
women to look attractive no matter what theirstruggles. And Wardrobe is about how dangerous
men will prey on girls no matter what they wear.In Rocio's mind, she was keeping the kids
safe. It's just that her methods for safetyaren't the same as yours or mine. They're twisted
to extremes by her own tragic experiences,causing everyone around her to run away in fear.
To the point that, when Charlie mentions Rocio'sbeen missing since 2010 and that they
need to find her, Grace responds with,Oh yeah, and that bombshell about Rocio
disappearing? That's basically where theseries ends, at least for now. After her dream
career and relationships were dashed and shedistorted her sight with real, but horrific
lessons, Rocio just disappears. Is she dead?Was she kidnapped? We never really get an
answer. Unless, of course, you are payingvery close attention. In the final frames of
the Rabbit Hole video, we are given one lastpoem to decipher. And it goes like this. She
stepped into the empty room at the edge of theuniverse and calmly walked towards the single
button on the wall, which, as she had been toldby the gods above, could delete the existence of
anyone she disliked. She thought long and hard ofall the ugliest souls she had ever known. She
made her decision, and her finger met the buttonwithout any ceremony. But looking down at her
feet, it was all red with blood. She stood inshock. The blood tainted her very being. She
thought deletion would be clean and instant,without realizing that death is the only deletion
that exists, and that there is no death withoutpainful, unrelenting grief. And grief stared at
her through mirrors forever. From the eyes ofall she had ever thought to delete, it was a world
catastrophe. Now, initially, the reading for thisseems pretty darn obvious. She wanted to delete
the person she disliked the most. In nearly everyLacey game, Lacey dies, usually by her own hands.
And in one case, we see Lacey being choked by anillustration of Rocio. Lacey was Rocio's optimism.
A fun-loving girl with lots of friends, a part ofher filled with the lies told to children. This
visual of choking occurs during a section aboutRocio killing off Jay, which was the result of
this illusion shattering. In that moment, Rociokilled her own creation and what it represented.
Lacey was the soul she disliked the most. But,at the end of the day, Lacey was still a part
of herself. And so, when she looked down afterhitting delete, she saw herself covered in blood.
She realized that, metaphorically, deleting Laceywasn't enough. It needed to be literal. Death is
the only true deletion. Which meant ending notjust Lacey's life, but her own too. However, while
that would be a suitably sad ending for a serieslike this, something didn't feel right to me. If
Rocio had died in 2010, I feel like her body wouldhave been found, right? And with the site being
as popular and as controversial as it was, thatwould have been a big story. Or at least been easy
to find with a quick Google search. For her tostill be missing, and her disappearance to be
considered a mystery, feels like the answercan't be that straightforward. Maybe that's just
the FNAF brain rot talking. But, as I went frameby frame through each video, there was a detail
that stood out to me. In the very first video,Lacey's Diner, we see this final frame. It depicts
a real person wrapped in some kind of cord or wirewith the caption, I'm in heaven. This is Rocio,
and while the use of heaven might make you thinkof peace and the afterlife, like someone might
believe they'd find if they unalived themselves,the fact she's able to write this seems to imply
that she's somehow still present to tell us this.That her heaven isn't the heaven we might expect.
The wires tying her up are also an interestingchoice. They actually repeat several times
throughout the series. In Pet Shop, we seethese wires tethering her to the ceiling.
The images are obviously super distorted,but the way those cables are hanging from the
ceiling and are clearly coiled, they remind meof computer or internet cables from my old media
company days. Then, in Rabbit Hole, we see severalflashes of Rocio tangled in those same wires.
Except this time, there's a circuit board throwninto the mix. Is this telling us that Rocio
somehow connected herself to the computer?That her afterlife is inside Lacey Games? I
know, it sounds far-fetched. Why would this game,grounded in gritty, disturbing realism, suddenly
take a supernatural turn? Believe me, I get it,but hear me out. Right at the end of Pet Shop,
Grace mentions that Rocio is likely dead. But,when she does, we suddenly see a face
appear in the screen with the word,Hello. This feels like Rocio showing us she isn't
dead, but alive and able to respond to things saidabout her. We see the same thing play out in the
Rabbit Hole video. In it, there's a moment wherethe screen cuts to a bunch of eyeballs looking
around. Then, the video of Charlie and Gracepops back up, only this time, it's inverted.
Like it's from the reverse point of view. Likesomeone within the computer looking out. As
Grace speaks and drops her not-very-friend-likeopinions about Rocio, the screen once again
begins to glitch out. It's reacting to whatshe's saying. Blood appears on the video window,
and the same face appears. Rocio is watchingeverything from inside the games. That's why
no one has been able to find her for 14 years.She's stuck somewhere no one can reach her.
Deleting herself didn't mean ending her life,just ending her existence in the physical
world. And now, she is inside her own creation.But, hope is not lost for Rocio. When Lacey first
enters the digital nightmare space in Pet Shop,she is confronted by Skele-Cat. Skele-Cat's
whole thing is that she's a rude gatekeeper,saying, I've been hurt, so I will hurt others.
This is exactly how Rocio has operated throughoutthe series. She was hurt by angry parents, by
her friend Grace, and so she went on to hurtother people. However, Skele-Cat isn't a lost
cause. Lacey's able to brighten her mood byreturning her skin, which allows the player to
proceed. She undoes the hurt that Skele-Cat hasbeen through. So, how do we metaphorically return
Rocio's skin? How do we help make up for the hurtshe suffered? That, I believe, will come down to
Grace and Charlie. Charlie is a fan of the site,and can make up for all those old criticisms
by showing appreciation for Rocio's work. She'ssharing it online with theorists like us, and we
always appreciate games like this. Charlie evensays that Jay, the controversial member of the
group, is her favourite character. As for Grace,Rocio is clearly listening out for her words
specifically. All Grace needs to do is lookinward and show this digital Rocio the kindness
she should have offered her back when they werepartners. Those small actions are all it's going
to take to save Rocio. At the very least, I thinkwe can all take away an important lesson from
Rocio's story. Behind all the content we consume,be it games, social media, or YouTube, there's a
person on the other side of that screen. Someonewho just wanted to bring some joy to people in a
world full of hate. You have no idea what they'vebeen through, what they're going through. Your
words have more impact than you realise. Let'sencourage that optimism and creative passion,
instead of encouraging people to destroy it.But hey, that's just a theory. A
GAME THEORY! Thanks for watching.And if you like theories about souls trapped
inside machines, why not check out our videoon the horrible fate of Mr. Tomatoes and
Miss Lemons. Welcome to the Matrix Theorists.Nintendo really got us good a few weeksago Nintendo revealed that they werereleasing an 18 rated horror game withthe tagline who is emo the teaserfeatured a man in creepy lightingwearing a paper bag with a drawn faceand Kani that spelled the smiling orlaughing man I was immediately hookedand began writing this very short aboutwho it was because that name isn't newit's actually a character from a shortstory called The Laughing Man and thecharacter was kidnapped by Bandits andhorribly disfigured so he would wear amask in the story he was a Robin Hoodstyle hero with great athleticism theability to speak to animals andconstantly outdoing Internationaldetectives sounds like a great premisefor Nintendo to use as the foundationfor their horror monster except thatisn't what we got just one week later itwas shown that this was a newinstallment in the famic con detectiveClub series and that the folklore usedfor the character was entirely made upthis was great news if you're a fan ofthis series it meant you finally got anew game but it did disappoint thepeople who were expecting something newand scary from Nintendo just goes toshow the power of marketing because youhave to admitI feel like this is where we kind ofhave to wrap catastrophe Crow is there alot of stuff that we need to get to yeahbut you know this could also be a Tomtask I could send Tom these guidancedocuments that I found or I withhold allof them and watch him suffer oh let'swatch him suffer yeah suffer suffersuffersuffer here we go again all right let'sdothis hello Internet welcome to GameTheory they show that like a crow isalways looking for shiny new theoriesalthough while today's theory isdefinitely shiny it isn't entirely new 3years ago we released a video on thecriminally underrated game catastropheCrow this quote unquote lost Nintendo 64game was full of great puzzles creepysymbolism and more lore than you couldShake a Tail Feather at and let me seeyou Shake a Tail Feather and you got allof that without even having to play thegame yeah this was one of those pet scopsituations where a bunch of YouTubersreleased videos about finding the gameonline and using their footage we wereable to piece together the story of lossand Desperation that was hiding beneaththe surface The Game Source Code waseventually dropped online and so peoplecould play it for themselves and solvethe last few remaining Mysteries but wehere a theorist figured that was prettymuch the end of it a cool oneandone ARGthat would slowly Fall Into Obscurity asthe internet continued to move forwardthat was until last year suddenly therewas an official catastrophe Crow plushybeam being released and with it a seriesof ads that teased something new comingApril 26th lo and behold April 26th camearound and the new thing we got was thegame again I was kind of expectingsomething you know new I guess it isnice you don't have to be elite hacka toget the source code working anymore sonaturally Matt and Ash checked it out onGT live and they were very keen to letme know that there was something moregoing on here sufferer and boy were theynot wrong there is so much moreHappening Here than there ever was inthe original there's now floating catheads mysterious cryptic Graves andbuildings covered in corpses we got herboys got her boys hanging out hey guysthese guys do seem like they're ready togo and I too am ready to go ready to goand decipher what the heck any of thismeans and figure out the true ending ofthis iconic ARG series catastrophe Crowlet's start with a quick refresher onwhat happened in the story all the wayback in October of 2020 it began withYouTuber Adam butcher releasing a videotitled what happened to Crow 64 where hereviewed the fictional history of anunreleased video game made for the N64it was called Crow 64 and was made by acompany called Opus interactive the gamewas originally slated for release in1999 and used an eternal Revival systemwhich supposedly would change the faceof gaming forever but as time went on itwas clear this eternal Revival systemwas more than just a game engine I meanobviously you don't pick a name likethat in indie horror unless it's literalthe founder Manfred Loren suffered thetragic loss of his da daughter Theawhile he was developing the game hewanted to use the Eternal Revival systemto do just that revive his quote littlecrow eternally inside the game Manfredmade a family of crows to representtheir family Manfred his wife Mara Theaand her little brother Nils thoughdespite his efforts it was all fornothing he was unable to bring her backonly really capturing Thea's final darkdays and so he dumped all the hardwareinto the ocean and then dove in himselfyou'd think this would be where itendsad parent tries to save their kid failsand can't take the guilt anymore so unallives themselves as punishment it'd be asad but complete story except it wasn'tthe end for Manfred in the original gamethere was a screen that was full ofblank spaces if you found all the codeshidden within the game and decoded themfrom the game's Crow language which isjust a simple substitution Cipher thenyou ended up with a message from Manfredto his dead daughter telling her thathe's sorry and how he is now trapped ina hell of his own creation the gameitself self his eternal Revival systemhad worked and now he is forced torelive his grief over and over again hisparting words are that this game is nowfor her brother Nils to play which iswhy it feels weird to me that we areable to play it ourselves if it was madespecifically for Nils then how is therea version available on mass feels likean invasion of privacy almost then againa corporation ignoring the wishes of itscreator doesn't sound all thatsurprising does it so I suppose weshould actually jump into the game tosee what we've got to play with when youboot up the game you are met with ablack screen full of blank text boxesexactly like the one we saw in the firstgame this is your main goal to fill outthose blank spaces and to do so thereare some really cool puzzles to solvebut unlike our usual ARG episodes whereI walk you through each of those puzzlesto get the ending I actually don't wantto spoil this one for you we've talkedabout this in our last video but thisgame is criminally underrated and thepuzzles are so good and satisfying tosolve that I'd encourage you to jumpinto the game and see if you can crackthe codes for yourselves and then showthe Creator some love while you're at ithonestly it is well worth it likethere's this one puzzle where you end upwalking through a maze and if you drawout your route it spells the code whothinks of that plus if you get stuckdon't worry there's actually a wholeGoogle doc that's been put together bythe community waiting to help you out sobig shout outs to everyone that helpedput that together over there but for nowlet's get into the meat of this to startoff with Everything feels familiar we'rein the same major hub outside of anoffice that we can walk into we hear thesame ringing of phones and clickyclacking of keyboards you can even findthe same secret in the same places likethe line on the floor that shows youwhere it's safe to walk the path belowToyland and the computer hidingunderneath the flower bed everything isright where it should be at least that'show it initially seems because when youtake a closer look things don't quitematch up for example the keyboardunderneath the flower beds in theoriginal game The Players had to walk onthe keyboard to highlight certain keysthat would spell out a code in Prolanguage but in this version no keyslight up at all not only that but nownext to the keyboard is a second doorand through it a second keypad and thecode for this puzzle is 332 how did thecommunity figure that out well it'sbecause of who released this version ofthe game the original was made by Opusinteractive but this one is made by acompany called Opus Legacy similar butdifferent just like the game they werealso the ones who were making theofficial Crow plushies and do you wantto guess how many they sold 300 32 usingthat code unlocks an area that is fullof conveyor belts and Crow plushiesclearly this isn't the 1999 version ofthe game that we all saw back in 2020this is a new version that has beenaltered by Opus Legacy and they've madea lot more changes than just the plushyroom from here the puzzles get tougherand the story gets so much moreinteresting but before we dive into thatI need to tell you about the sponsor fortoday's video Opera Opera is the fastersafer and smarter browser that isperfect for anything you do online whenI'm writing theories like this one Ioften have multiple tabs open ARGdocuments ciphers YouTube videos youname it I think my personal record is150 tabs I may have a problem but thanksto Opera that is a problem of the pastbecause now I'm able to effortlesslyorganize my tabs into tab Islands I cannow group my tabs by category puttingciphers into one Island my research intoanother and by Google dogs into anotherOpera also uses context clues to helpautomatically create new islands so whenI open up a bunch of YouTube tabs fromthis args assortment of fake creatorsOpera recognizes they're all from thesame place and groups them together thenwhen I feel like I'm running out ofspace I can just collapse the islandsinto these tiny colored pills stillthere if I need them but way lesscluttered and way easier to sort throughresearching for theories also means I'moften stuck reading pages and pages oftext and there's no worse feeling thangetting to the end of a scientific paperon the anatomy of crows only to realizeit didn't have the answers I was lookingfor but thanks to Opera

canfind a grandfather clock that clicksnine times and then 13 times if you goand change your computer's clock to 913when you spawn in the main hub it willbe night time and manfred's house willspawn behind you everything in it feelslike it did in the original game that isuntil you get to Thea's room in thefirst game we saw a dying Crow on ahospital bed before they got draggedaway into the darkness but now we justsee this weird floating cat hat itdoesn't do anything other than offer yousix underscores before multiplyingrapidly and crashing the game for thisto be replacing her cryptic death scenefrom the original it feels like opa'sLegacy is trying to give us more detailsin what actually happened to Thea in ourvideo we theorized that Thea fell downthe stairs and suffered a brain injurywhich is why our playable Crow characterhas a broken wing and why we saw piecesof brain scans at certain points but inthis game we don't just get Snippets ofthe brain scan we get the whole dangthing and she doesn't have brain damageif you make it to the hospital world youcan see the brain scan on the wall andif you reverse image search it you'llfind an image called MRI brain tumorsuddenly those six underscores from thecat head become abundantly clear cancerthat is what the cat head represents ithas the same weird fleshy texture you'dexpect from a cancer cell and it keepsmultiplying until eventually your wholesystem shuts down just like the gamedoes it wasn't brain damage caused by afall it was a fall caused by her havinga seizure due to a brain tumor man Ifeel so much worse for these charactersknowing that this is what they weregoing through and to some degree I caneven sympathize with manfred's desire tokeep his daughter alive after she wastaken from them far too soon but thechanges don't end here you may rememberthat after we fall down the stairs ascarecrow like figure rushes towards youand crashes the game this characterappeared multiple times throughout thegame sometimes it would just flee fromyou most of the time it would swarm youlike we just talked about but this isn'tjust a random enemy on manfred's desk inthe work building we can find a Loren'sfamily portrait however when you walkaway from the picture it will brieflyflash to an alternate image replacinghis wife Mar with the Scarecrow thismonster that attacks us or stops ourprogress in the original is manfred'srepresentation of his wife after thedeath of Thea their marriage fell apartshe left him and based on his final noteto her it implied that she took his onlyremaining child Nils with her he saw heras a monster someone that would halt hisprogress someone that would only hurthis little crow family and so heliterally made her into the thing thatis designed to scare crows so that we asthe players would also see her as thevillain but in this new game we getsomething different the Scarecrow doesshow up again and still flees from usoccasionally but we don't get swarmed byit anymore instead during the DesertWorld it actually leads us to where weneed to go the Loren's family homeinside you can find the Scarecrowsitting in the armchair peacefully notattacking you not resetting you justwatching Mar's actions have been changedthey're no longer that of an angrymonster trying to hurt us but helpfuland caring just wanting her little crowto come home unlike most sequels it's itdoesn't seem like these changes arebeing used to add to the previous storybut rather to challenge our ideas ofwhat that original story was thatoriginal story was from manfred'sperspective we saw things the way he didand felt sympathy for him but OpusLegacy is rewriting that story showingus the truth behind these situations howThea died of cancer how Mara was a goodmother and how Manfred wasn't there forany of them but if Fus Legacy can tellus what the truth is they would have tobe someone who knows the truth to beginwith and from what we learned last timewe only have a couple of options Manfredand Thea are dead so it can't be them itcould be Mar she would have knowneverything and likely wouldn't have beentoo happy with the depiction of her butthere's one more candidate who fits thebill way more take another look at thatpicture from manfred's office when youmove away Marta isn't the only one whochanges form Niels also does Nilsbecomes what has been dubbed a crawlerlooking very similar to the Scarecrowbut crawling around on the floor you gotto love beautiful Simplicity we oftensee it alongside the Scarecrow in theoriginal game Neils was often home withhis mother and likely went with her whenshe left to Manfred Neils was beingcorrupted by his wife turning him into amonster just like her but how does thisprove that Nils is the one behind opa'sLegacy well do you remember what Ishowed you guys right at the start ofthis episode we got her boys got herboys hanging out hey guys the officebuilding that Manfred worked at in theoriginal game is now infested withcrawlers because Nils has taken over thethe business and is now the one workingon the game altering it to make surethat we see the full picture his motherwasn't a monster she was a kind andcaring mother that just wanted to saveher children from the monster herhusband became that's why if youactivate a switch that's out of boundsin the office a new monster appears alarge and scrawny Crow will begin tochase you around the office and if youlisten closely you can hear the sound oflow pitchcrying this is how Nick sees Manfred hecried over his daughter spendingcountless hours in the office endlesslypursuing her Revival with the game andso it seems fitting that Nils made thisgame's monster a deformed version of TheCrow characters his father created eventhe change in the name reflects theshift in perspective the word Opus comesfrom the phrase magnum opus whichtypically refers to a work of art thatis considered the artist's mostimportant Da Vinci's Mona Lisa Queen'sBohemian rapid and for Manfred it wasCrow 6 before the ability to save hisdaughter save anyone and allow them tolive forever inside a game that would behis magnum opus Opus interactive but nowwe have Nels coming in as Opus Legacyand Legacy is all about the impact thatyou or your greatest work leave behindafter you Dies who lives who tells yoursure this game could have been manfred'sgreatest work but ultimately it turnedhim into a monster and that is theLegacy he left behind and now thanks toNils the whole world knows however Nilsstory doesn't end there after he fixedall the issues he saw he continuedadding things to the game that show uswhat became of him after his father'sdeath if you jump into the well you willfind yourself in an underground mazesurrounded by Blood by opening one ofthe greates you can find fourgravestones though you may notice thatthey're a little tricky to understandthey're not written in English and it'snot Crow language either this is what isknown as a DOT Cipher the way you readit is actually pretty simple once youget the hang of there all you have to dois set these dots on a grid with a Y AISlabeled from zero to nine with the zerobeing at the bottom and nine being atthe top then you just need to see whatnumber each dot is aligned with on thegrid in this case the numbers are dateslike you would see on a gravestonetelling us the birth and death dates ofthese characters the first Stone's deathdate reaches the 5th of December 2001which is around the same time Manfredjumped into the ocean so this must behis gravestone with the rest thereforebeing Mara who's still alive and doesn'thave a death date Thea and Nils butthese aren't the only gravestones youcan find if you manage to clip throughthe floor you'll find four more Gravesbut these ones are colorcoded one grayone pink and two blue the gray one isactually a repeat of Neil's grave fromearlier meaning that this is supposed tobe his family the pink grave has a closebirth date to him so this would be hiswife and then the two blue graves arefrom 2019 and 2020 his two children Nelshas grown up he now has a family of hisown and thankfully there's not a deathdate on any of these gravestones sothey're all still here which means thathe can be there for his children likehis father never was for him his legacywould be different except there was onelast thing he had to do before thatcould happen I mentioned at the startthere are codes hidden throughout thisgame if you collect them all and putthem into the computer under the flowerbed you unlock the final cut scene in itwe see four crows standing together onegray one pink and two blue just like thegravestones this is nil's family andeverything is fine until we see thevisionaire Cipher from the original gameflash on screen the one from manfred'snote to Mar that translates to Nils I'malive this message causes nil's head todetach from his body and glitch out he'sbeen going crazy trying to figure it outhow is his father still alive how canhis father be reaching out to him andthat I believe is the the real reason hebuilt this version of the game if youtranslate all of those codes from Crowlanguage it creates a letter from Nilsto Manfred just like the one Manfredwrote in the first game and it says thisfather I was so angry I could not reachyou with the claws you gave me everyyear you drowned we ran and ran but wecould not Escape that Silent House inthe end your little crows were only madeas play things to call you back oncemore but now you have died twice lost inthe noise so I build my own I learn yourlanguage to warm the hell you built fromthe depths with one last code at thestart of the cut scene that says notforgiving but willing to take one lastleap the changes he made weren't justbecause they weren't the full story butbecause Manfred couldn't be found in theversion he'd made with the tools Nielshad been given Nils said he died asecond time and we see that as a thirddate on manfred's gravestone the 5th ofDecember 2020 the same day that thesource code for the original game wasreleased and the same day we got thisvideo from one of the ARG YouTubechannels Ultra 64 forever where we seefather Crow Manfred rise up through allof the worlds and disappear into theether this was his second death when thesource code was released Manfred becameunreachable maybe his soul within theEternal Revival system was being splitacross too many copies of the gamebecause suddenly everyone online had aversion of it he became lost in thenoise so Neils did the only thing hecould he started over he learned hisfather's Crow language and built his ownversion of the game a version that onlycan be played from your browser meaningthere's only one copy that is hosted ina single location all of this was to tryand guide his father back and the crazything is it worked during the originalARG the community found a working emailaddress that they could send messages todoing so gave them a response from mlManfred Loren and one one of thoseresponses was addressed to Niels askinghim to meet in the place they wouldholiday every year after that email wasreceived we got two more videos fromUltra 64 forever showing father Crowstanding in a forest waiting patientlyfor Nils to find him but nothing everhappened that was until the communityunlocked the final cut scene for thisnew version of the game when thathappened Ultra 64 forever uploaded onefinal video and it was titled the end wesee father Crow once again standing inthe the forest footsteps can be heardand we see a small Crow walk into framethat small Crow is brother crow the crowcharacter that has represented Nilswithin the Crow family the two crowsturn to each other and begin to talk asthe screen Fates to Black Nils plan hadworked he took that last leap and thistime was able to find his father wherehe promised he would meet him all thoseyears ago Manfred was back no longerlost in the noise he got the meeting healways wanted he could say all thethings he wanted to say and maybefinally he could rest as for Nels he maynot have forgiven his father for what hedid to him or his mother or to Thea buthe was at least willing to talk it outwith him one last time and now thatmessage that was driving him crazy forso long would no longer have any powerover him he did what his father askedhim to do and he found him now Nils canfinally move on and with his familystart creating his own legacy instead ofliving living in someone else's but heythat's just a theory a game theorythanks for watching and if you'reinterested in more law from N64 gamesthat never existed

the show that's happy to letsomeone else s that for a change sincethe release of security breach it feelslike there's been a massive new wave ofFNAF theorizing on YouTube we've seenthe rise of people like John FNAF Rytoast ID's fantasy and dozens more alljoining us in the good fight to try andsolve the infuriating law of thisfranchise and just over a month ago anew Challenger or should I sayChallengers entered the ring the channeldual process Theory and they went bigfor their first outing making the claimthat they'd solved the entirety of FNAFin their very first video and not onlywere they laying down a timeline for thewhole series they also claimed to have aparticular mystery that has been buggingus theorists for a long time what is thename of the crying child after nearly 10years we still just call him the cryingchild despite the fact that every othercharacter in this franchise seems to geta name Mike Elizabeth Charlie even themissing children got names so why isthis kid's name left blank wellaccording to jeel process Theory it'snot that he doesn't have a name it'sthat we just missed it we've had thename all along we've just been giving itto someone else say suggest that thecrying child name is Cassidy the name wefound all the way back in the wordsearch of the survival log book the samename that for the longest time we havegiven to the vengeful Spirit fromultimate custom Knight the one afonshould not have killed not only that butthey claim that the child we thought wasCassidy doesn't even exist for yearswe've assumed that there are seven deadkids five missing children's incidentvictims including Cassidy CharlotteEmily the puppet and the nameless cryingchild but instead they claim that therehave only ever been six with the finalmissing kid and the bite victim beingone in the same Cassidy Afton it's abold claim but when you get into themeat of it their argument is actuallyquite compelling so I went back to thedrawing board and started mapping outthe pieces myself to see if I could cometo that same conclusion is the cryingchild actually Cassidy ladies andgentlemen it's hey Tom what you doing ohhey Matt I'm uh kind of in the middle ofsolving FNAF yeah okay I'm sure you havea theory that changes is everything aclue that we missed kind of yeah perfectwell before you fire up the old goldenFreddy thumbnail and then slap A DarkTruth on that I've got another puzzlefor you to solvely it's the music based mystery projectthat I've been working on basically it'swhat you get if you have Loi girl butyou mix in a murder mystery because whohasn't ever wondered that I know but thegood news is you don't have to wonderanymore because episode one is finallyready on one level you could just studyand relax and sleep to the music thatyou're listening to then in fact you'vebeen listening to one of the tracks thiswhole time and there's going to be newmusic releasing every week on our lfiSpotify Channel but you know what if youwant to go level deeper hidden withinsome of that music and the videos thatexist here on YouTube there are Cluespointing at the story of a missing kid amissing kid named Gregory Gregoryseriously Matt yeah yeah hear me outhear me out yeah I got nothing I justwanted to meme on the name good newsthough my Gregory not a robot yeah surefor now I assume you put a link in thedescription on your way in I did indeedand people should definitely click on itbecause like I said there's going to benew Secrets waiting to be discoveredevery week over on Spotify and a newanimation dropping roughly once a monthmonth and a half here on YouTube all aswe help a new character Taylor solve thedeadly game that she accidentally findsherself trapped in do I really have tosolve this I kind of got my hands fullwith all the FNAF stuff coming down thepipeline I was actually just about to doa Morty on Dual process theories Theoryoh I remember that one it's a greatvideo but uh you do realize the m instands for Matt Pat right Matt Patoccasionally reviews theories yo huhdidn't think about that say Matt I knowyou're kind of retired and everythingbut seeing how dual process theoriesvideo was a two person effort and you'realready here how' you like to tag teamthis FNAF Theory I mean it's a littlecramped in the recording closet with thetwo of us but uh sure why not awesomeand now I don't have to change the themesong Hit It Yosi leave your theories inthe comments below I'll pick myfavorites in the next episode of Morfirst things first it's probably a goodidea that we recap the main evidencepoints dual process theory has for thecrying child being Cassidy their videois nearly 2 hours long after all who hasthat much time well except for youconsidering you took over 4 hours toreact to it look I'm retired now I'vegot nothing but time but I think you'reright so let's quickly recap startingwith the first major Point how we gotthe name in the survival log book nowthis book has been a Cornerstone of theFNAF franchise since its release insidewe have three separate people speakingto us Michael Afton who writes in redpen a spirit that writes in faded textand a third person that alters the textof the book The Faded text writes thewords my name on a number of the pagesand on those pages there's always somesort of weird number take all thosenumbers and turn them into coordinatesfor the word search and Bam you get thename Cassidy it sounds so simple now butI remember ripping my hair out over thisat the same time you were but the key tothe whole thing was one very importantusage of my name on one of the pages themy name appears on a grave Stone justlike the gravestone missing a name fromFNAF 6's ending which it should beremembered released around the same timeas this book so it seemed pretty darnobvious that these Clues were revealingthe name of that final character thefifth missing child which is why for thelongest time we've been calling thefifth child Cassidy and this is wheredual process Theory throws their firstspanner into the works you mean wrenchlook you chose a British guy to takeover this is what you get W yes my nameappeared on every page the clues werehiding notice what's on the oppositepage of the word search a mirror andunder it the spirit leaves a messagewhat do you see well what's on the otherpage a crying child using altered textin the word search it's me Cassidy Godso good it is pretty compellingespecially cuz in all honesty theplacement of that mirror always feltsuspicious to me so I really like themusing it for their Theory but if cryingchild is Cassidy then who else isspeaking in the book you need a secondSpirit to act as the FedEd text wellaccording to them it's Charlie thepuppet doing what she's been trying todo the entire series help the LostSpirits find themselves and again I gotto say I really like that narrativelythat's really satisfying because itbrings together the three maincharacters from the franchise all in thesame place Mike with his red pen cryingchild Cassidy as the altered text andCharlie guiding the conversation as theghostly faded text it's cool and itfeels complete but is there actualevidence to support this or is it allhypothesis and that's not all dualprocess Theory weren't just satisfiedwith crying child having ced's name theywent further to suggest that the cryingchild is Cassidy as in Cassidy is anafon and the fifth missing child on thegravestone and the spirit within goldenFreddy the only spirit inside a goldenFreddy as opposed to most of ourtheories where the crying child is one/half of our best Golden Boy they alsohave the evidence to back it up thefirst point is that golden Freddydoesn't speak in plurals when you take alook at the one line we ever get fromGolden Freddy what do we see it's me mesingular implying that there's only onespirit in there compare that to what wesee in the books throughout the seriesthere have only been two in instances ofanimatronics possessed by multiplepeople the first is the Stitch wraithfrom the Fazbear fr's epilogues thesecond is Rosie pork chop from theFazbear fright story together foreverand while the Stitch wraith isn't ableto speak until the second soul is goneRosie pork chop speaks while stillcontaining both spirits and refers toitself as ladies in waiting it's usingplurals showing the two Spirits we'regoing to come back to that point rightyeah don't worry we're going to comeback to all of this okay great cuz Ihave thoughts on that one the secondpoint they bring up is everyone'sfavorite FNAF 3 classic happiest daythis is the final miname where we seethe puppet giving cake to the birthdaychild surrounded by their friends inanimatronic masks once the puppetdelivers the cake the child stops cryingputs on their golden Freddy mask and allthe children's Spirits move on wellexcept for Charlie because she's stillgot to show up in FNAF 6 yeah becausenothing can ever just be as it seemswith this franchise but there is onething that I think we can both agree isvery straightforward there are only sixkids at this party the five children andthe puppet if there were supposed to betwo Spirits inside golden Freddy whyisn't there a seventh kid which ties inperfectly to point number three theglowing eyes at the end of FNAF 3 thisone's personal so I'll take it as areminder if you beat FNAF 3 withoutdoing the happiest day mini game get thegame's bad ending this gives us a screenwhere our four main animatronics eachhave one glowing eye symbolic of thefact that their Spirits haven't beenreleased yet seems prettyself-explanatory right but then look whowe have in the back golden Freddy withnot just one glowing eye but two thiswas always the backbone to the whole twoSpirits debate the idea that unlike allthe other animatronics who each had onekid's spirit inside of them goldenFreddy was different he had two both theinnocent crying child Spirit and thevengeful Spirit Cassidy the fifth victimit was a theory that was furthersupported by the books specifically theStitch WTH Stingers where we see ananimatronic possessed by two Spirits anice wholesome kid named Jake and anevil angry Spirit named Andrew one whodies in a hospital setting like thecrying child and one who dies by a brutemurder from afon I mean the parallelsare hard to deny however dual processchallenges this by calling out the factthat if there were indeed two spirits inthe body why then do both eyes go outonce you complete happiest dayespecially since we've believed that theCassidy Spirit lingers on to tortureAfton in ultimate custom night only onelight should have gone out to which Ihave one answer redcon but obviouslythat's a bit of a cheap explanation ifwe can avoid it which brings us to duelprocess's last Point how can the cryingchild be the fifth missing kid when veryCLE clearly he's not missing like he'sliterally right here in front of a largeroom of people well they make theassumption that this was all part ofWilliam's scheme after the bite of 83William pulls his child out of thehospital and while experimenting withharvesting Remnant has the bright ideato stuff his son into golden Freddywhoops bad idea will it doesn't work andthe spring locks kill him which is whywe see golden Freddy twitching inultimate custom night in the same wayWilliam does during the FNAF 3 teaserthis mistake devastates him and and in adrunken stuper he lashes out at Henry'sdaughter Charlie killing her last thisthen aligns with what we see from thegravestone puzzle in help wanted to tosolve it you have to light thegravestones marked by the six deadchildren in a specific order presumablythe order in which they died Chica thefirst she has seen everything followedby foxy Freddy Bonnie then golden Freddyand finally the puppets later when thepolice start to investigate thedisappearances at the restaurant Williamclaims his child also went missing tothrow them off the scent that he may bethe killer now while I don't really lovethe logical jumpster explanation takesthere one thing I really do like aboutthe crying child being the fifth missingvictim and therefore the only spiritinside golden Freddy is that it reallydoes help clean up the numbers for yearsfive was the magic number in FNAF whenit came to dead kids then around FNAF 3it evolved into six with the inclusionof the puppet and yet FNAF 4 shows uswhat was presumably a seventh kid dyingin the form of the crying child andwhile help Wana does eventually give usseven Graves and a hidden out of boundsEaster egg it always bug me that therewas never a bravestone for him in theFNAF 6 ending I always just assumed thatit was because he ended up beingdifferent he wasn't a victim of aftonsand thus he wasn't included in thatfinal image but if crying child is infact the fifth kid it helps explain whythere was never an additional grave forhim because he was always there to beginwith he was the one hidden behind thegrass they also don't mention this intheir Theory but in F 3 look at theSpirit who gets afon spring locked theyhave tears streaming down their facejust like the crying child we never seethe other Spirits faces was specificallybeing shown that this one has tearsrevealing that this isn't a separateSpirit from the crying child they areone in the same Scott even used the samemodel in FNAF World specifically for thecrying child to be fair tears areeverywhere in the series though I meanthe puppet is shown crying literally allthe time so are we done did they solveFNAF can I retire now too no you stillhave to solve poppy no andlfi okay and ban Bno but secondly well this theory isreally satisfying from a narrativestandpoint it helps to simplify a lot ofthe confusing elements that have builtup over the years there are a few piecesof evidence that they didn't mentionthat might poke a few holes in theirTheory oh yeah so Tom what's this soundit's a flatline and when does theFlatline happen well a flatline istypically Shand to show that someone hasdied usually in a hospital exactly andduring FNAF 4 we see things like IV bagspills and flowers surrounding the bedall things that you would see in ahospital crying child was in thehospital for his injuries and then wehear a flatline right after Afton saysthat he's going to put his son backtogether Aton leaves represented bypsychic friend Fred Bear fading awaywhich then leaves crying child alone inthe dark he's lost in the darkness he'sdead he's alone everything about thiscut scene seems to be suggesting that hedied in this Hospital could youpotentially make the argument thatWilliam pulled his son off of lifesupport in the hospital and brought himback to an underground bunker where he'sgoing to do experiments on him untilhe's able to bring him back to life andand that's why we hear a flatline heresure you could make that argument but itfeels really over complicated just forthe sake of your theory and even stillif he did do all of that there's a roomfull of people that saw afton's Sun getbit that make it pretty darn hard forAfton to convince anyone that his sunwent missing as part of some randomKiller's murdering spree there's alsothat whole speaking in plurals thing Iknow you had thoughts on yes thank you Ibrought up earlier the huge number ofparallels between the two Spirits insidethe Stitch Wraith in the books and thetwo spirits that are potentially insideof golden Fred in the games now say whatyou will about book based evidence butthe epilogues at the end of these thingstend to be very important forstorytelling I mean we saw thatexplicitly with the reveal of the mimicso to focus on this character of theStitch wraith comprised of two Spiritsacross 11 books yeah that feels prettydarn important and in The Stingers eachspirit inside the Stitch wraith speaksin the first person so it would thenmake sense for one spirit inside ofgolden Freddy to say it's me singularit's me the crying child your brotherbut let's go a level deeper and TheStingers the Stitch wraith is made up ofa mix of Parts Andrew the angry one isestablished to not be able to seebecause his part forms the body Jake thenice one can see because his spirit istrapped in the head part as such hereports what's happening in the worldback to Andrew in the body and what dowe see happening in the log book wellit's a similar sort of dynamic oneSpirit asks what do you see and theother one responds I can't see it's adirect parallel even down to thehappiest day mini game there's a pointin The Stingers when Jake is given thechance to move on and pass into theAfterlife but he chooses to linger backin order to help Andrew eventually oneof them moves on while the other is keptto Earth held back by Afton soundfamiliar it should it once againparallels a lot of what we're seeinghappen with golden Freddy in the gameson top of that dual process Theoryreminded me of this moment in FF forsmini gamess where the crying child islocked in the back room with a goldenFreddy costume they pointed out thetoughs of hair coming out of the suitexplaining this to be an employee whobled out however in one of our oldvideos you made the valuable point thatthis head is just sitting too low in theTorso when adults wear it we see theirheads fully out even when they'resitting this is something that isexplicitly shown to us in places likethe graphic novels which tells us thenthat the person in the suit here it'sgot to be a child again we see this inthe books in Fazbear frights we havescenes where kids reach into the goldenFreddy's suit and see black curly hairsitting inside this is a dead kid a deadkid that we know was put inside ofgolden Freddy presumably this should bethe fifth missing child this is whycrying child's fredbear plushy tells himremember what you saw he has literallyseen the deaths of other kids huh youever thought that maybe that's theanswer what do you mean well is itpossible that the story is actually waysimpler than we the FNAF Community havemade it out to be I mean look at thescene like really look at the scene itis pretty darn self-explanatory a kid islocked in the storage closet and literaltfts of hair are sticking out of thesuit I remember when I first saw thisscene I overthought this thing to deathassuming that it had to be more thanjust hair sticking out of the suit maybethey were wires or tfts of suit hair orsomething like that because this was1983 and by all accounts it was thefirst location it was fredbear's FamilyDiner the beginning of the timeline themissing children's incident didn'thappen here it was at Freddy Fazbear'sPizza clearly these Brown pixels had torepresent something else but inretrospect the scene is pretty explicitthere's a kid dead in the suit done cutand dry remember what you saw you saw adead kid we as theorists are so oftendesperate to search for narrativesatisfaction we bend over backwards totry and justify timelines where afon iskilling kids because of Elizabeth'sdeath or because he's trying to put hisson back together and he wants to runexperiments to harvest Remnant fromother kids but what if he's just a weirdsick dude who just started killing kidsone day no over complicated backstoryrequired I didn't get to talk about thisbefore leaving the channel but in helpwanted to if you light the finalgravestones in a very specific order youunlock a huge lore clue in the form ofthe Bonnie mask this is the moment thatbasically confirms that we're playingthe game as Bonnie bro but the order ofthe gravestone it feels very intentionalthey explicitly give us an order ofevents chica first then foxy FreddyBonnie golden Freddy 5th puppet last itwas really confusing because Charliedying last didn't make any sort of sensewhat about this a wound first inflictedon me and yet this gravestone evidenceis what the games are telling us it'salso kind of what we're seeing in FNAF 4if that TFT of hair is to be believedand really why wouldn't we believe itthat gravestone timeline could probablybe right Aton was just killing kidsbecause he could he was a der CH aserial killer man retirement really hastaken a toll on you but I also think Isee where you're going with this cryingchild Witnesses the dead kids in thesuits and then gets bit by fredbear onthe day of his party Aton would bedevastated by this promising to put hisson back together he'd be furious at hisbusiness partner Henry because it washis engineering that did this to his boythen one night an opportunity presenteditself Charlie was locked outside bysome bullies and so Aton in a fit ofrage killed Charlie unlike all the otherkillings that were premeditated this wasa crime of passion and so it broke fromall of his usual methods and that allowsthis new order of deaths that Ste willhas given us to make way more sensechica was always the first but not justof the MCI of all the deaths that's whyHenry made security puppet in the firstplace because there were a bunch of kidsdisappearing from the Pizzeria and Henrywanted to protect his daughter whichbrings us back to the beginning wheredid we land with the whole dual processTheory did did they solve FNAF isCassidy the crying I think the answer isyes but also no there are two sides tothis coin right is crying child thefifth missing kid that we've calledCassidy for all these years I'm just notsure it would simplify a lot especiallythe the three mini games where there'sonly five kids but then we see a kidalready dead inside the golden Freddysuit before crying child even dies andthen there's the dozens of people thatwatch him die and Flatline at the end ofFNAF 4 which would make it hard for himto be considered missing let aloneconsidered one of the missing childrenspecifically it's true as much as I likeit from a narrative standpoint there'sjust as much evidence against it as itis supporting it typical FNAF you knowwell not completely because there's thesecond side of this question sure cryingchild might not be the fifth missingchild but based on what jeel processTheory presented I think they might beright that crying child's name isCassidy William Aton a deranged serialkiller hiding in plain sight until oneday his son Michael decided to play aprank a prank that would kill hisyoungest son Cassidy afon it has a nicering to it I've got to admit maybe and II definitely see it it's just afrustrating Catch 22 you know we eitherget to have the crying child's name andin the process we lose the establishedfifth missing kid name or Cassidy is thefifth missing kid and crying childremains his nameless as he ever was Imean the answer's got to be in heresomewhere surely the altered textopposite the mirror Returns the spirit'squestions with who are you what's yourname and with Cassidy not being thefifth missing kid that leaves the myname gravestone clue wide open honestlymy money's on the foxy grid we never didsolve it and there's ghostly textwritten at the start maybe we shouldtake another look no no no no there's nowe here my friend I did my time withthat foxy grid this is all on you man ohwell then I guess I better get startedit's not like I had a billion other FNAFthings to worry about regardless Isuppose I should thank you for helpingme out with this episode Matt I know lfihas kept you pretty busy oh yeah lfinearly forgot that I was on here topromote that just got so caught up inthe FNAF discussion anyway I shouldprobably get back to working on that theteam and I have worked really hard tomake this project as great as it can bean episode one just launched today hereon YouTube so if you're in need of somechill beats for studying working orsleeping May sure you check out thelaifi project over on Spotify we've gotnew music releases dropping every weekor so with Clues hidden inside so makesure you follow us there to listen assoon as they drop but if you want tolevel up your experience you can alwayshead on over to the YouTube channel andtry to piece together the clues to helpTaylor solve the mystery surroundingthis definitely not a robot kid Gregorywe've got new animations coming eachmonth that are full to the brim withthat sweet sweetL you just couldn't help yourself couldyou hey I'm retired I don't get to sayit that much anymore true do you knowwhat else you don't get to say muchanymore but hey that's just a theory agame theory thanks for watchingfallout's fat man is a fat lie the fatman is one of the most iconic weapons inFallout launching a mini nuclear bomb todestroy anything and everything howeveryou can also use it from literally feetaway so how dangerous is it really wellthe smallest nuke ever designed was thew54 at 50.9 L and it packed a punchworth 20 tons of TNT but the mini nukeonly weighs 12 l so by scaling down thew54 we can estimate the mini nuk'sexplosive power to be around 4.7 tons ofTNT that explosion would vaporizeanything within M with guaranteedfatalities at 37 M and anyone within 350M receiving a fatal dose of radiationthat is way more dangerous than we seein the game that is if it actually wentoff see to create an explosion thenuclear material inside has to reachcritical mass plutonium has the smallestcritical mass of all nuclear materialsat just 22 lb but even that's almostdouble the weight of the mini nukebasically this bomb is bombing it's justtoo small to reach critical mass andeven if it did you'd likely nukeyourself at the process so just likevoltex vaultsthe trial Chambers fill an important Gapin the Minecraft timeline that's rightthese secret underground rooms are morethan just a new challenge for veteranplayers they are a window into the livesof the civilization who came before themobs and weapons Left Behind revealedthey weren't just hiding undergroundfrom a monster they were preparing tofight back and they were doing so withthe help of an unusualAlly hello Internet welcome to GameTheory the show that's always up for achallenge and MOJ definitely heard thatcall because they've just released a newupdate and it is called the trickytrials this update is designed toseriously test your metal introducing anew structure called the trial Chambersfilled with spawners that continue tospout enemies until the trial ends it'sa nice new challenge for longtimeplayers especially since the last majorchallenge was the warden and now that'sbasically just become a play thingrather than a threat I got a pictureyou're not scary are you but of coursethat's not the only thing this updateoffers these Chambers are filled to thebrim with the stuff that we theoristslove we've got brand new Mobs like thebog and the breeze we've got newenchantments shirs and armor trims we'veeven got new offensive weapons like thewind charge and the mace which make adevastating combo if mastered but themain reason this place stood out to mewas because you can only find the trialChambers underground between levels y -20 and Y -40 and with that we have oursecond key word you know when we hearthe words underground and structure thatcan only mean one one thing ancientBuilders the original race of Builderswho summoned the Wither and fledunderground to escape its wrath Oneupdate at a time we have been slowlygetting more clarity on who these guyswere and what their story is but we'venever really known much about what lifewas like for them after they fledunderground until this update because itturns out redstone contraptions andmysterious portals weren't their onlysolution to the current problem nor werethe ancient Builders the only ones whodecided to take matters into their ownhands there was another group who formedan alliance with the ancient Buildersand the proof for all of this was rightunder our noses the whole time so grabyour trial Keys theorists because we aregoing to unlock the secrets hidden inthe tricky[Music][Music]outside of the fact that the trialChambers are underground just like theancient cities and the strongholds therewere a few other details that TI me offto the ancient Builder involvement inthese Chambers first of all is theobvious sense of craftsmanship it'sbuilt out of tough and copper blocks andwhile those raw materials are common atthis depth these variations are notnaturally occurring in the Overworldsomeone had to Chisel these blocks tolook like that villagers and illagersaren't capable of that as we see theirVillages and Woodland Mansions only useSimple blocks the only place we seethese types of chiseled blocks in theOverworld are in places like the deserttemples and jungle pyramids which werealso built by the ancient Buildersthere's also the use of redstone thetrial Chambers are full of redstonecontraptions like dispensers and copperbulbs in the ancient cities we saw theancient Builders experimenting withdifferent Redstone Circuits and they'deven set up redstone traps in the junglepyramids so redstone contraptions are intheir repertoire finally there's thoseall important Pottery shirts I thoughtthese things were so uninteresting whenthey were first announced but man havethey turned out to be crucial to thelore of this game previously we've saidhow the pottery shirs were the ancientBuilders depicting parts of their ownhistory and they have been a big help inunderstanding different elements of thisSociety like the fact they were multipletribes or rather than one cohesive groupand now the shs are here again in thetrial Chambers meaning the ancientBuilders had to be here at some pointbut some point is a little vague and wecan do better than that in fact we canfind out exactly when these trialChambers existed in the timeline andit's all thanks to one thing the lootchests in the past we found chests invarious structures built by the ancientBuilders and the specific loot you gethelps to show the development of theircivilization in the Nether fortressesyou can find things like golden armorgolden weapons and diamonds but in theend cities they've evolved into turningdiamonds into armor and weapons evenlearning how to enchant them over timethe ancient Builders grew and developedtheir technology so depending on thekind of loop we get from these trialChambers we should be able to figure outwhere in the timeline it fits the keyitems that stood out to me were thediamond chest plate and the enchantedbooks why because it falls right in themiddle of the two points I've mentionedthe Nether fortresses and the nendcities in the end we basically haveevery kind of diamond armor or weaponbut here we only have one piece of armorthe chest plate they hadn't developedthe full suit of diamond armor whileusing these Chambers and that meansthese Chambers were in existence beforethe ancient Builders fled to the endwhich makes a lot of sense it'd be weirdif they came after because they're meantto be stuck in the end regardless italso shows us that it comes after theyfirst went to the nether as diamondarmor hadn't been created at that pointthey were still using golden armor plusnone of the armor in the nether isEnchanted so the presence of anenchanted book in the trial Chambersmeans they've begun experimenting withenchanting their tools that enchantedbook also ties it to another specificunderground structure the ancient citieswhose loot chests once again offerenchanted books and a single diamondarmor piece these two places offersimilar loot show the same level ofsocietal development meaning the ancientcities and the trial Chambers existedaround the same time so we know when thetrial Chambers existed the question nowis why do they exist what did theancient Builders need them for and thisis where we get to talk about the newbig bad mob of these Chambers the breezethough calling them the new Big Badmight be a stretch they're more of anuisance than anything they don'tactually do much damage only half aheart if they hit you directly insteadthey use their wind charge projectilesto throw you you around the room causingyou to die due to full damage ratherthan actual damage it's quite annoyingbut it does make for an interestingChallenge and that got me thinking atthis point in the story the ancientBuilders had been forced underground bythe monster they' created the Withertheir scientists were trying to figureout a way to escape using Redstone soulsand portals but what would they do ifthe Wither attacked before then theywould need some form of Defense to fendoff the threat in order to buy them moretime and Evacuate the city now thebreeze isn't going to help with thatthey're hostile to the player and asI've said it can barely do any damage tothe player let alone the Wither butthat's not what I think the breeze wasfor do you remember when the ancientcities released we got that special lawmusic disc disc five well on it we hear[Music]this the sound of an army marching intobattle that was the defense the ancientBuilders had in mind however you don'tjust gain an army overnight you have totrain people and to do that you wouldneed to put them through a bunch ofexercises or trials this is where thebreeze comes in it wasn't there to fightoff the Wither it was brought in totrain potential soldiers to fight theWither just like the Wither the breezeshoots projectiles at them sending themflying you can't shoot the breeze witharrows either just like how the Withersecond phase is immune to allprojectiles the breeze was the perfectpractice dummy for their fight againstthe Wither and they could practice allof this without actually taking too muchphysical damage or dying this is whythey built the trial Chambers potentialsoldiers could go in again and and againlearning and improving each time inorder that they could protect theirunderground cities from the Wither andit was all thanks to the breeze having avery similar fighting style with none ofthe destruction though this wasn't justluck on their part it would be too muchof a coincidence for them to just find amob that happens to do little to nodamage and happens to have similarabilities to their number one Enemy Nothe breeze wasn't just found like thisit was designed to be this way by theancient Builders see the breeze doesn'tactually spawn naturally in Minecraft itonly comes from the spawners found inthe trial Chambers and in MinecraftLegends we play as the ancient Builderswho are shown to be able to makeSpawners the Minecraft Buildersunderstood how spawners worked and howto use them to create life they couldjust make a mob to help them in thissituation except everything they made inthe game wasn't new they were Golems ormobs that had existed prior thanks tothe Godlike beings who looked over theland sure the ancient Builders can makespawners but that doesn't mean theycould just make a new mob using themright wrong because we have an exampleof them doing exactly that and it's witha mob that bears a striking resemblanceto the breeze while the breeze appearsto have a complex design when you breakit down it's actually quite simple it'san elemental mob made of rods with acube head and it can shoot projectilesthat is identical to what we see from amob we find in the nether The Blaze anelemental mob made of rods with a cubehead and it can shoot projectiles we'veactually had requests to do an episodeon these guys but we never really sawthe point because their lore isbasically spelled out for us in theMinecraft mobestiary but for this videoit does give us some interesting Insightquote The Blaze does not spontaneouslyexist in the nether rather it isconjured into existence by a spawnerjust like the breeze Blaze also don'tspawn naturally they can only besummoned by a spawner and those spawnersonly exist inside Nether fortressesstructures We Believe to have also beencreated by the ancient Builders long agothe ancient Builders are well-versed increating these new mobs for whateverthey need at that point in time in

get the breezerods to make the breeze so that you canget the breezerods this was quickly becoming mychicken or egg debate and despiteenjoying the odd philosophicaldiscussion this was starting to hurt mybrain so I decided to put it down andtake another look at some of the areasI'd already explored to see whether anything could give me some clarity andwhen I did I noticed something odd I wastaking a look back through the lootchests and while I'd earlier made noteof the armor and enchanted books I'd notpaid attention to the weapons you'regiven despite this being a chamber meantfor battle the only weapons you get areaxes bows and crossbows not only is acrossbow going to be pretty uselessagainst the breeze but we've never hadcrossbows appear as loot in the chestsleft by the ancient Builders before thisgame is pretty consistent with the typeof loot you get usually the ancientBuilder chest include pickaxes shovelsswords all things they used for miningbuilding and fighting but not once dothese chests contain crossbows so whywould these weapons suddenly be in theancient Builder item chests simplebecause the ancient Builders weren't theonly ones making the trial Chambers theyhad help if you're wanting to kick yourtrial up a notch you can turn the nexttrial into an ominous trial which spawnharder Mobs with more armor and offerbetter rewards like higher levelenchantment or diamond blocks but what'sinteresting is the way that these hardertrials are triggered it happens bydrinking an ominous bottle which is anew item you receive by beating thetrial Chambers but it can also bedropped when you kill an iller Captainbefore this update killing an illagerCaptain would immediately curse you butnow instead of cursing you the illerwill just drop an ominous bottle thatwill allow you to become cursed onceyou've consumed it with this curse youcan trigger raids or you can trigger anominous trial if the illers carry thesepotions which give you the same Cod thathistorically was given to you naturallyby them then it would stand a reasonthat these potions have been made by theillers meaning the ancient Builders wereusing iller magic in the trial Chambersand no this wasn't just the ancientBuilders killing the illers and stealingtheir stuff not only did the illerscontinue to idolize them after they'regone which I'm not sure they do if thebuilders had killed a bunch of them butif you take a look at the ancient citiesyou'll find one structure that isn'tlike the others one that is made up ofdark oak instead of deep slates one thatlooks susp viciously like a PillagerOutpost the illers didn't just help thembuild the chambers they literally livedalongside them working and learningtogether trying desperately to figureout how to solve the problem of theWither we've known for a while that theilles have been following and worshipingThe Works of the ancient Builders theylearned how to fight from them inMinecraft Legends and since then theywould try and do as they did recreatingtheir Maps beds and end portals fromwool but throughout all of this we'vealways pictured them as watching from adistance hearing the stories but nevernever really being involved until nowthe Wither was a threat to all of themafter all no one in the Overworld wassafe and so just like with the originalpiglin Invasion the illers wanted tohelp they were able to use their magicto create these ominous bottles andbecause they understood this magic wereable to help the ancient Buildersutilize its strange effects to increasethe difficulty of the trial Chambersthat's why you receive crossbows andaxes as rewards from these trials thoseare the iller iconic weapons in factcrossbows can only be found in Overworldloot chest at Pillager outposts they arehelping to reward and equip any ancientBuilder that completes the trials mixingin their prized possessions andstrongest weapons in with the ancientBuilders sure they might not have fullygrasped all the technology that wasgoing on they were still making portalsout of wool but they didn't need to theywere there to provide magical supportand to provide the necessary items tocreate the trial chamber's primary mobthat's right the illagers are also thefinal piece to our Breeze puzzle in 2020there was a DLC from minecra dungeonscalled The Howling peaks in it you musthead to the top of a large mountain andone of the places you

snifferhappy building theoristsLook at this hand from Amanda the Adventurer 2's
demo. Count the number of fingers. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.That might seem pretty unsurprising,but throughout the game we are
constantly shown that Amandadoesn't have 5 fingers. She has 4. That single
detail was enough to send me down a rabbit hole,and revealed there was more lore in
this small demo than meets the eye.Hello Internet! Welcome to Game Theory, the
show that'll point and click on everything tofind the lore. You should get your clicker
fingers ready too, because not only is therea shiny subscribe button beneath this video
for you to click, wink wink, but the Internet'sfavourite, albeit horrifying, version of
Dora the Explorer is back to once againvacantly stare into my soul. If you're
unaware, this is Amanda the Adventurer,and she is the main character for a game that was
initially made as part of a game jam that blewup a couple of years ago. Since then, it was
turned into a full game where we try to figureout what happened to some local missing kids in
our aunt's attic using VHS tapes from an old kidsTV show, Amanda the Adventurer. However, it
becomes immediately clear that something isoff with this show. It discusses a lot of strange
subjects like rotting flesh, playing with knives,and if you don't answer how Amanda wants you to,
she begins to freak out and turns into a monsterthat'll come and kill you. Kids TV certainly has
changed since I was a kid. I'll just stick toThomas the Tank Engine, thanks. But as you
progress, you have a chance to unlock secrettapes, and by doing so, you begin to learn the
truth about why this show is the way it is.Amanda was a real person, played by a
girl named Rebecca. Her dad, Sam Colton,created Amanda the Adventurer and sold it to
a company called Hamelin Entertainment. Theywere the ones who made it such a hit, but they
also are the ones who made things go awry. Theywanted to create an interactive show, and to do
it, they tricked Rebecca into summoning a demonentity. I feel like there was an easier way to
do this, but indie horror gotta indie horror,I guess. Regardless, one of these demons did
manifest, and now it inhabits her body. Iteven kept the cute pigtails. But Rebecca wasn't
completely lost. No, her mind was transferredinto the show. We see evidence of neurosurgical
experts in the show's credit, and whenever webring up something from Rebecca's real life,
Amanda gets mad, and suddenly, the demon isknocking on our door trying to hunt us down. And
the hunt has begun again, because now we have ademo for the upcoming sequel where we are
continuing our investigation at a local library.After picking up a couple of books with funny
names, you can find the code for the cabinetscrawled inside them, and that gives you access
to the first of two tapes this demo has to offer.They operate as expected. Click on things
and type in the answers. Get them wrong,and Amanda gets mad and begins to manipulate
the tapes. It once again feels very simple,but if we've learnt anything from this franchise,
it's that nothing is ever quite as it seems.There are secrets hiding throughout these tapes.
Some of them are blinking you'll miss it moments,and others are hiding in plain sight.
So grab your library cards theorists,because we've got to hit the books to figure
out what's going on in Amanda the Adventurer 2.When you boot up the game, we are met with our
classic CRT with Amanda's logo on the screen.Though, if you wait long enough, you'll start
to see those blinking you'll miss it moments Imentioned. The screen will begin to glitch out
and occasionally reveal some new messages. Wordslike let me out plastered over the screen with
a hand pressed up against the screen in the topright. According to the game's Steam page,
this would appear to be Amanda who is quote,doing everything to find a way to free herself.
Although, notice the amount of fingers. This handhas five fingers. Throughout the demo, we are
being shown Amanda's hand over and over againto count coins. Attention is being drawn to it,
and it very distinctly only has four fingers.Which is appropriately creepy for a demon child,
but it means it doesn't match our hand on the TV.This cannot be Amanda speaking to us. At least,
not literally. Instead, it's most likely meantto be showing us the real Amanda. Rebecca. The
human child whose mind was forced to live out herdays inside the VHS tape. We've seen Rebecca
occasionally try to break through in the past.Amanda is typically bright and cheery, but when
we ask her about her dad Sam, it leads to glitchesand resets of the tape. The real Rebecca is coming
to the surface. This is just another instance ofthat. She is trying to reach out to us directly
for help. This message is from her. And while hertrying to escape isn't anything groundbreaking,
knowing she's the author of these messages isimportant, because it's not the only message
we get from this screen. If you keep waiting,something else will appear on the CRT. A secret
code. And if you've been a fan of Amanda for awhile, you'll probably recognise it as the code
used in the Steam demo for the first Amanda theAdventurer. In this demo, the code appeared on
the fridge behind Amanda, and it translated toPAUSE. TURN ON THE OVEN NOW. So by using those
same symbols, we're able to decipher this newmessage, and it reads as follows. He tried to
find me. Actually, we only knew it said he triedto IND me, we didn't have a symbol for the letter
F. But I think we can all agree it makes sensegiven the context. Regardless, who is the he she's
talking about? The demon? It was hard to say,but fortunately there is another code that helps
us narrow it down. On the Amanda 2 Steam page,before the demo was released, there were four
drawings. These are clearly made by Rebecca,as they're all drawn from her perspective as
Amanda. The entity is a meanie, she's trappedinside the TV with bars over the screen,she even references us as her
new friend watching her tapes,all things that Amanda slash Rebecca
has experienced. These are her drawings,but that's not all. If you mess with the exposure,
you can find those same symbols hidden in eachone. Putting them together gives you the phrase
IT WILL FIND YOU. These messages initially seemto be about the same thing. He tried to find me.
It'll find you too. The Steam page for Amanda 2also hints that the demon is after us, and
throughout the demo we can hear it crawlingaround the ceiling. So it would make sense that
that's what she's referring to. But two thingsstood out to me. One, she said he TRIED to
find me. We know the demon DID find Amanda,she is possessed after all. So that seems to
not line up. But the second thing is her use ofpronouns. In the first message, she uses HE,
while the second uses IT. Which tells me thatshe's actually talking about two separate entities
here. Why else would she change how she refers tothem? The IT is almost certainly the demon entity
we've already established is chasing us in thisnew demo, and it's not really a guy, gal, or
non-binary pal. It's a thing, a demon, a monster,an IT. But then, who is she talking about when
she says HE? Well, the only male character weare fully aware of so far is Sam, Rebecca's
adoptive father and the creator of Amanda theAdventurer. It would make sense that if his
daughter suddenly disappeared, or he felt likehis daughter was suddenly possessed by a demon,
that he would go looking for the real Rebecca.It's just good fatherly behaviour, which is a
nice change from our usual indie horror fathers.But Sam is also missing. And in our last theory,
we concluded that Sam was actually a guinea pigfor the mind transfer experiment that Hamelin
Entertainment was doing, testing it on himbefore they tried it out on Rebecca. This was
all because we got this VHS tape showing Rebeccaon her own signing a document before being takenaway to a room by members
of Hamelin Entertainment.We presumed this meant Sam had already gone
missing, but I'm not so sure that's the caseanymore. We don't know for sure when Sam went
missing. The news report doesn't give us a date,instead it just talks about future events being
cancelled and to give Rebecca some privacy. Thatwould make you think that Rebecca was still
around prior to Sam's disappearance. Butthen we got this moment from the new demo.
Amanda sells one of her stuffed toys,specifically a rooster. This franchise loves
its symbolism, with lots of elements like thelonely kitten trapped in a cage from the first
game, representing Rebecca trapped in the TVby Hamelin Entertainment. During the what isfamily tape from the first
game, we also encounter arooster, and she asks us what it's called. If
instead of rooster we type in Sam, Amanda beginsto freak out. The rooster is a representation of
Sam, but her giving him up like this for moneyfeels like a reflection of that moment we saw
with Rebecca signing the papers. Maybe she wasgiven promises of money or travel, things that
Sam wasn't able to give her, and so she wasencouraged to cut him out of the picture. Or maybe
it was to be emancipated so she could make her owndecisions, or so Hamelin could do whatever they
wanted because Sam couldn't stop them. Eitherway, she's removing Sam for some kind of reward,
and is then led to a guarded room and likelyexperimented on, turning her into the monster we
know today. And if that happened, Sam would betrying to find her, sticking his
nose where Hamelin doesn't want it,and so they would just decide todispose of him. But there is one part of our
original Sam theory that this game seems tobe bringing up, one that has been hotly debated
since the original release of the game. Is Samactually Wooly? There are a lot of interpretations
out there right now, and it's fair, we actuallydon't have a lot to work with, but the main reason
I ask this now is because of this moment in thedemo where Amanda asks us who we'd like to go
see. If you go ahead and write Sam, she'll respondlike she did in the family tape from the first
game. However, if you instead say Wooly, you geta very different response.Those are two completely opposite
responses. Surely that means they can'tbe the same character. And that's true, if Amanda
doesn't know they're the same character. And I saythat because outside of this moment, the parallels
between Sam and Wooly are only getting stronger.On the penultimate tape from the first game,
we saw Amanda trying to do surgery on Wooly,killing him in the process on the operating
table, showing that whoever Wooly is, he wasoperated on and turned into another character just
like Rebecca was, and just like we suspect Sam tobe. In this new demo, Wooly is noticeably absent.
He's even missing from the logo. And when we askAmanda about him, she just teases us about whether
we can find him. Wooly is missing, and we aren'tsupposed to be able to locate him,which is awfully similar to what
we know about Sam. He went missingat the hands of Hamelin, and no one has been able
to find him yet. During the second tape in Amanda2, which is basically just a teaser
for the full game, we get this moment.Last time we went to the woods was in the very
first demo for the game, and if you remember,in that demo we were given a Google map view of a
circle marked in those woods. We were then givena typing prompt, and the correct answer was Wooly.
Wooly is what was buried in the woods. Only inthat original demo, the forest he's buried in
was a real forest, not an animated show forest,and there's only one other place we've seen a
real forest show up in this series. During thenews report about Sam's disappearance, we see
police officers interviewing people next to thewoods. Sam went missing and is likely buried deep
in those woods, just like Wooly. This is why weget this moment in the final tape from the latest
demo. She's looking at a dead Wooly, buried ina hole in the woods. But I also suspect based on
the glitches, it's a moment where we can tell herwhat she's really seeing. And if we type in Sam,
she'll start to make the connection. Up until now,she's not been aware of who Wooly really is. He's
just a buzzkill that doesn't let her do all thetwisted things she wants to do. But whenever
we bring up Sam, the mask begins to fall,and the real Rebecca begins to shine through,
trying to remember who she really is. When shecomes across Wooly in that hole, something is
going to click, connecting the real life burialsite of her dad to the burial site of Wooly.
And that is going to once again bring the realRebecca to the surface. And the more we can make
that happen, the better chance we are going tohave of freeing her. However, while we're trying
to help Amanda, it appears like we're going tobe facing some opposition going forward. No,
I don't mean the demonic Amanda that's in theceiling. I'm talking about something way worse.
An opossum. No, this isn't a joke. In the maindemo tape, while Amanda is trying to get enough
coins to visit her three places, she is attackedby an opossum who steals her coins away. This
is clearly meant to be referencing Swiper fromDora the Explorer, a fox that would try to swipe
whatever important item they had on them. Sadly,we don't get to sit here and yell at our screen,
Swiper, no swiping! Instead, we just have toclick on the opossum as he runs away, which makes
sense, but you know, I'd have been up for a newgame mechanic, I'm just saying. This might just
seem like a cute little reference at first, butthey show up again in the second tape to attack
Amanda in the bathroom, and Amanda says somethinginteresting. That line, who even are you, set off
my theory alarms. It makes sense for her to wonderhow a pest got into her house, but wondering who
they are? The only reason she'd say that is tohelp clue us in that they're supposed to be
someone important. Plus, the types of animalcharacters we see in this game do seem to matter.
Wooly being a sheep shows that he's just fallingin line, doing what he's told by Amanda and
Hamelin. So, I started looking into opossums tosee if there was anything I could learn that might
help us figure out who this is. The first thing Iremembered from my biology classes was the
opossum's diet, and I promise I'm going somewherewith this. While they are omnivores, meaning
they basically eat anything, they're known asopportunistic omnivores. Rather than hunting
things, they will take whatever they happen tocome across, and one thing that is known to
include is carrion, otherwise known as rottingflesh, something we are very familiar with in
this series. Amanda's physical body is rottingaway somewhere, and now, suddenly there's a
creature known for consuming rotten flesh clawingat Amanda? That can't be a coincidence, and it
likely means whoever or whatever the opossum is,it's more likely connected to Amanda's physical
body than it is her new TV persona. However,they are also known for eating non-rotting
creatures too. Most notably, despite a lotof bad press, they are considered very useful
for humans, as they also eat other pests,like rodents. And when I think of rodents, I
immediately think back to what we learned inour last theory. The name Hamelin comes from the
story of the Pied Piper, where the Piper luresall the rats out of Hamelin Town. When the town
won't pay, he then leads all the children outof the town as well. Last time we saw that Hamelin
was drawing all the children away from theirhomes, they were the rats, and we believe they
ended up in the show like Rebecca did, just asbackground objects with eyes. Hamelin wasconsuming them for their own
personal gain, just like anopossum consumes rats. The opossum is Hamelin,
either a person from Hamelin, or just somethingput in place by Hamelin to keep Amanda on track.
In the initial tape, Amanda wants us to go tothe Isle of Dead Dolls. The Isle of Dead Dolls
is an island located near Mexico City, and thelegend goes that a man came across a dead girl
in the canal. The next day, a doll floated downthat same canal, so he fished it out and hung it
up in the trees to ward off evil spirits. That'swhy Amanda asks us, she's trying to ward off evil
spirits, the demon that is controlling her. ButHamelin doesn't want her to fend off the demonthat they've tried so hard
to summon, nor do they wantAmanda escaping her TV prison. So, the opossum
shows up and steals the coins from her hand tostop her progressing. But the connection goes even
deeper when you start to look at the spiritualmeaning behind the opossum. I've mentioned how the
opossum is this game's version of Dora's Swiper,and we did a whole theory over on our sister
channel about how Swiper is actually an evilfox spirit living inside
a computer game. And givenwe're dealing with demons inside of a video game,it felt kind of important to check outthose spiritual elements too.
Unlike the fox, the opossumis far less common in folktales. I could only
find a handful from North and South America,and they also seem to paint the opossum as a
trickster, much like their foxy counterparts.However, they are sometimes shown to be
different, mainly that they are foolish and vain.There's one Native American legend called Why
Opossum's Tail is Bare, and in it we learn theopossum is jealous of the raccoon's striped tail
and wanted one of its own. It asked the raccoonhow it got them, and was told to wrap its tail in
bark where it wanted the rings, and then to lightit on fire. Yeah, I think you can probablysee where this is going. It
did just that, and in doingso it set its whole tail on fire, and the burns
were so bad that the fur never grew back, leavingits bare tail. To me, this reflects exactly what
we've seen from Hamelin Entertainment. They weremessing with forces they didn't understand,
demonology, all in the attempt to make the perfectviral kids show. But their hubris caused their
downfall. Much like the opossum, their planbackfired. They summoned a demon,but they couldn't control it, and
now it's out in the world. And thechild they put into the TV is now rebelling too,
talking about horrible subjects and ruining thereputation of the show. Everything went up in
smoke. It might even be more literal than thattoo. The opossum might actually be one
of the members of Hamelin we've seen,like the businessmanor one of the doctors, trapped inside the show
thanks to their own hubris. Now it's going to beup to us to fend off the Hamelin opossum from
Amanda, and help her to realise the truth inorder to help her escape this prison. And that
my friends, is what I predict the story of Amandathe Adventurer 2 is going to be. The only question
I have left is, who was the raccoon? In the folktale, it was a raccoon that led the opossum to
burning its own tail. Did Hamelin think it wasjust too big to fail, or was there someone else
pulling the strings? Another person or show theywere trying to learn from who tricked them into
summoning these demons, only for Hamelin to fallvictim to their schemes. I guess we're just gonna
have to wait and see when the full game releaseslater this year. In the meantime theorists,
remember, it's all just a theory. A GAME THEORY!Thanks for watching, and if

Smith.At the end of his show, the Stephen A. Smith Show,he typically shifts gears from talking about sportsto answering fan questions from Twitterabout literally anything.This has varied wildly,from who would your starting five pick befrom the Sesame Street.First of all, my start five, Cookie Monster.What kind of bender would you be?You know what?When I watch Aquaman, I think water.Or who you think the best SpongeBob athlete is.Now, SpongeBob with the big square head,I gotta consider thatbecause I always wish I had a big square head.It's pretty random and it's kind of hilariousto watch him stumble his way through pop culture references.Ladies and gentlemen,I haven't seen much of SpongeBob, damn it.But one of them stood out above all the rest.Someone asked Stephen,who would win in a 1v1 game of basketball?LeBron James or Mewtwo?That's right, the Pokemon.People lost their minds over this,mainly because of how he said the name Mewtwo.Mewtwo?I never thought of Mewtwo as a cow before,but now that I have, I can't unthink it.Of course, the discussion raged on Twitter.Could LeBron James actually stand up to the likes of Mewtwo?Surely it's a one-sided fight, right?We all saw what happened the last timea human went toe-to-toe with Mewtwo.The Pokemon fan in me, along with the rest of the internet,thought this was an open and shut case.But the theorist in me knew I couldn't leave this upto a hypothetical.I mean, LeBron is arguablyone of the greatest basketball players of all time.I may have been the kid in high schoolbeing bullied by the jocks,but I actually enjoyed basketball.Less the playing partand more the learning the rules and regulations part.Yeah, I was a nerd.What did you expect?But I can't imagine that a lot of Mewtwo's movesetswould be legal in an actual game of basketball.Plus, I think we forget that LeBron is more than just a man.While Mewtwo has appeared in dozens of games,movies, and episodes of the show,LeBron has also made appearancesin over 38 NBA video games,a number of movies and TV shows,and a few other mediumsthat all offer their own unique styles and powersthat might just help level the playing field.So, get out your rule books, theorists,because we are going to answer the questionthat Stephen A. Smith couldn't.We are going to go through everythingto see who would win in a game of basketball.Legendary NBA player LeBron Jamesor legendary psychic Pokemon Mewtwo?Ladies and gentlemen, it's game on.As I've already mentioned it,let's start with some basic rulesbefore we really get into this.Obviously, groups like the NBA, NCAA,and the International Basketball Federation, or FIBA,never had to account for psychic powers before.So, we're gonna be doing our bestto interpret the rules as fairly as possiblein a way that keeps things fun,but also means the spirit of the gameremains somewhat intact.For example, Mewtwo could use his psychic powersto just hold LeBron in placeand have free reign over the court.Now, there isn't technically a rule against that,but there is a rule that says,a player shall not hold, push, charge into,or impede the progress of an opponent.Typically, this applies to physical contact,but I think it would be safe to saythat regardless of how you hold the player,it's still impeding their progressand breaks the spirit of the game.Therefore, this won't be allowed.Similarly, there's a rule about doing somethingthat is considered, quote, detrimental to the game,which is basically the ref's Air Bud clause.Just because it's not in the rulesdoesn't mean it's okay to do.So, if Mewtwo tried busting out some of his powersthat we see from Pokemon the first movie,like mind controlling LeBronor erasing his memory of basketball,that would likely fall into this category.Not exactly good sportsmanship to make itso your opponent can't even face you properly.Other rules, however, require a lot less interpretation.The NBA has policies against surpassingyour natural ability thanks to synthetic substances,or as most people call them, PD.So, I don't think Mewtwo taking those weirdTM, HM, disc things and learning a new move from themis gonna fly either.With that out of the way,let's dive into the specifics of how a humanmight win a game of basketball against a psychic cat.The most important factor when it comesto winning a game of basketballis, of course, your ability to score.And how you can achieve that can be broken downinto a few key areas.Starting with the most obvious one, height.When you have another player trying to block your shots,having a few extra inches makes it that much easierto make it over them.Conversely, being taller also makes it easierto block your opposing shots.And as Steven pointed out,he's shorter than LeBron, but he weighs more.LeBron is two inches taller than Mewtwo.So, there you have it, case closed.Kinda.Because you see, height is actuallyonly part of the equation.You're not shooting from your head after all,but your arms.The bigger your wingspan is,the higher you can reach to block or shoot.According to Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man,your wingspan should be the same as your height.But, fun fact, that's not how humans work.I had to get measured for a shoot once,and it turns out my wingspan is actuallythree inches shorter than my height.So, while I'm by no means short,I do technically have short arms.And it turns out, LeBron also has the same issue,just in the other direction.He's six foot nine, but he's gained an extrathree inches in his wingspan,making it a whole seven feet.Mewtwo, on the other hand, looks lanky,but actually is pretty average in that department.By taking Mewtwo's 3D model from one of the gamesand posing him to assert dominance,you can see that he fits neatly into a perfect square.That means that his wingspan is exactly the sameas his height, six foot and seven inches,which is impressive, but not comparedto LeBron's seven foot wingspan.But, Mewtwo has one final trick up his sleeve.He can mega evolve.Mega Mewtwo X specifically gains an entire foot of height,and it gives him an infinite wingspan,as, according to his Pokedex entry,its psychic power has augmented its muscles,which we then see in Pokken leads to limbsthat can stretch infinitely.However, that's not gonna fly here,as in order to mega evolve,Mewtwo has to be holding the Mewtwo Knight X item,and FIBA has a very specific rule about that.Quote, any equipment that is designedto increase a player's height or reach,or in any other way give an unfair advantage,is not permitted.The Mewtwo Knight would be considered such an item.Literally making him taller and longer,and therefore is going to be disallowed from play.At this point, I was starting to think LeBronmight actually stand a chance.A lot of Mewtwo's powers have been disallowed,and he doesn't have the height or wingspan to keep up.But, sadly, it's all downhill from here for LeBron.Remember, wingspan and height matter for the same reason.You want to be able to reach up and block shots,and to shoot over the opponent,or just reach the basket directly.But there's another element that can add to your heightthat is less physical.Vertical leap, or how high you can jump.And boy, oh boy, does Mewtwo clean up in this department.In Super Smash Bros. Ultimate's training arena,you can see that the top of Mewtwo's headgoes from two meters to 4.8 meters in a single jump.That's a vertical leap of 2.8 meters,or nine feet and two inches.He would be able to clear LeBron easily,and still have space to go,because LeBron only has a vertical jump heightof 1.1 meters, or three feet and eight inches.Which is impressive by human standards,it's about a foot taller than the league average,but he ain't getting over Mewtwoor blocking any shots with that.Or is he?See, this is where LeBron'sextracurricular activities come into play.And the first thing I turned towas his starring role in Space Jam 2.Now, I'd never seen Space Jam 2,but Michael Jordan got some pretty cool stretch powersin the first one, and that would be a huge advantage here.So, I sat down and I watched the whole thing,and man, does this movie suck.Wait.I could do a whole video just complaining about it,but the most frustrating thing, besides LeBron's acting,is LeBron doesn't even get any powers.He only gets boosts from the core,and his son gets a bunch of powers,but he doesn't get any, which is a complete letdown.But don't worry, from the ashes of Space Jam 2,there would rise a phoenix that would bring me hope.Warner Bros. Smash clone multiverses.Okay, maybe Phoenix was a bit strong.The game is fine, I guess.More like a scorched chicken.But LeBron is a playable character, so we gotta try.I analyzed some of his jumps in the game,and using pixel measurements,we can conclude that his vertical leapis around eight foot four inches,which is nothing to snuff at,though it still fails to match upto Mewtwo's nine foot two inches.And it gets worse when you consider thatin basically every TV or movie appearance,Mewtwo can just levitate.It's basically just an infinite extension of his jump,going as high or as far as he wants toto get over LeBron and position himselfperfectly next to the net.You can't get a travel violationif your feet don't touch the ground.But to top it all off, Mewtwo doesn't even need to jumpor levitate to win here,because it's time to talk about the thingthat I know you've all been screaming at methis entire time, his psychic powers.Those give him the biggest advantage of all,perfect accuracy.He can throw the ball from anywhere on the courtand just manipulate it to go exactly where he wants it to,while LeBron only has a 59.9 effective field goal percentage,meaning he's missing 40% of his shots.Is there any way he could improve those odds?Besides, you know, just getting good?Turns out, yeah, because as I mentioned earlier,LeBron has been in dozens of NBA titles,and one of them broke away from the realismand gave you power-ups to fix this exact problem.The game is called NBA Playgrounds,and in it, you could activate powers known as lottery picks,one of which is called Electric Ball.This power-up makes your next shot unmissable,and it cannot be blocked.So even with Mewtwo's height, levitation,and psychic abilities,he's not going to be able to stop LeBron,if LeBron is able to get this power-up, that is.Not only are lottery picks randomized,but their randomization is actually weighted,with Electric Ball being more likelyto go to those already winning the game.Given LeBron's lack in every areacompared to Mewtwo so far, he definitely isn't.Plus, you build up your lottery pick barby doing things like dunking,which LeBron also isn't gonna be able to dowithout the power-up.Mewtwo can just perfectly block every shot.Okay, so things are looking pretty bad for LeBron here,but he isn't completely defenseless.While his defense stat in most NBA games isn't super great,in multiverses, it's a different story.When he doesn't have the ball,his down triangle attack called Deniedchanges to create a fence behind himthat can perfectly block incoming projectiles.Now, as we've shown, he doesn't have the height or wingspanto get in front of the ball as it's being shot,but he does have enough height, wingspan, and leapto get in front of the basket,which are only 10 feet off the ground.Therefore, he could just jump up and block the ballfrom going in at the last minute.Now, if you're a fan of basketball,at this point, you're probably yelling at methat this tactic wouldn't work,as blocking the ball that is in, quote,downward flight towards the basketwould be considered goaltending, and you'd be right.But there is an exception,and that's if an offensive player is dunking the ball.So long as the ball hasn't left their hand,it's not considered in downward flight,and therefore, you can use your hand to block the ball.And if Mewtwo's psychic powers are consideredbreaking the rules of holding a player,which is normally associated with physical contact,then Mewtwo using psychic powers to hold and guide the ballalso count as physical contact,which means that even if Mewtwo is shootingfrom the other side of the court,it would still be considered a dunkbecause the ball never entered downward flight.It's still being held by the player.Now, I'm not saying Mewtwo can't use those powers.It just means that if he does,it would allow LeBron to jump up and block the ballwith his denied attack without receiving a penalty.And the best part is,if LeBron does successfully block Mewtwo's shotwith that power, in the game,he immediately gains possession of the ball.Possession is actually the second major partof winning at basketball.The more you have the ball,the more opportunities you have to shoot.Sure, we've established that shootingis going to be a challenge with Mewtwo's jumping advantages,but if he can keep the ball away from Mewtwo,then he might be able to figure something out, right?Well, I thought so too,but the issue arises that LeBroncan't just hold onto the ball forever.He's either going to have to start dribblingto get closer to the basket,or take a shot at some point.And in both instances,he's going to have to let go of the ball,which gives Mewtwo the chance to use his speed, strength,and psychic powers to steal the balland immediately go for another shot.Though, if Mewtwo didn't want to wait for LeBron,he could always do what Steven suggested.That long tail, you never know.Might strip him.Stripping the ball is just when a defensive playerknocks the ball out of the offensive player's hand.And LeBron isn't used to defendingagainst a third appendage.All of these options lead to Mewtwoonce again psychically dunking,LeBron denying,and the cycle repeating over and over againuntil the heat death of the universe.Or until LeBron gets too tiredand Mewtwo manages to score some baskets.Basically, no matter what way you slice it,LeBron is not winning this match.The internet was right,and I was ready to give up.There's just no way the King is coming back from this.I'd watched every cameo appearance he ever did on TV.Nothing.I watched gameplay from every NBA video game there isto look for power-ups and scoring bonuses.Nada.I even checked all the random mobile games he's in,including the Pokemon Go clone, NBA All World.Huh, a second Nintendo clone featuring LeBron.Weird.Oh, and now I have two nickels.Regardless, I had zero to work with.Every appearance was boring,played for laughs,and gave him no powers,which is especially disappointingwhen he cameos in shows like Teen Titans,which are about superheroes.And that's when it hit me.Where's the one place we'd expect someoneto have superhuman abilities more than anywhere else?Comics.They do collaborations with other media entitiesall the time,and LeBron is no exception.He's got a DC comic and two Marvel comic appearances,and one of them completely flips the tables on Mewtwo.It's called LeBron, King of the Rings,and it's all about LeBron's hypothetical riseto gaining the seven championship ringsthat he declared he would win.It's honestly a lot of funbecause the creators are basicallyjust making jabs at his ego,but it all adds up to LeBron getting some insane powers.For starters, LeBron can levitate.That's right, he apparently spent some timewith some street magicians,and instead of getting scammed out of his millions,he learns to fly,meaning he's going toe-to-toe with Mewtwo.The sky is quite literally the limit.Suddenly, LeBron can use his deny attackon any shot from any height,and he doesn't have to riskthe potential goal-tending strategy.Although, here you might thinkthat this is where LeBron fallsinto the same issues as before.Mewtwo will steal the ball back when he lets go,and we'll end up in a continuous loop again,but oh no, because,and I can't believe I'm saying this,LeBron can also turn invisible.Yep, he trained with Tibetan monksand learned to turn invisible.Not only that, but the comics specifically call outhow it's useful for getting around players during a game,which means it's unlikely we're gettingthe invisible woman powers from the 2005 moviewhere she can only turn herself invisible,but not her clothes.It would be a pretty useless strategyif we could still see LeBron's uniformand the ball while he's holding it.Instead, it seems like these powersreflect the actual Marvel comic version of Invisible Woman,where in 1964, she was given the abilityto turn objects around her invisible too.So, just remember kids,the movie can never be as good as the original.Anyway, this level of power would allow LeBronto turn himself and the ball invisible.Mewtwo won't be able to see himor aim any kind of psychic power at him.It's pretty hard to focus your energyon moving a ball you can't see.And yes, while Mewtwo has telepathy,movies like Detective Pikachushow that he's able to be snuck up on and captured,so he's not super aware of things that he can't see.LeBron can just do his multi-versus block,get hold of the ball, turn invisible,levitate towards the basket, and dunk.But would invisibility even be allowed?Well, the NBA and the comic didn't seem to mind.And even if they did,Mewtwo or the ref would have to catch LeBron doing it,which is gonna be pretty hardbecause LeBron has one final trick up his sleeve.He can create decoys.It's not fully explained how he does this,but we do know there is a movethat does the same thing in the Pokemon games.Substitute.Quote, the user makes a copy of itselfusing some of its HP.The copy serves as the user's decoy.And despite Mewtwo being one of the most intelligentand powerful Pokemon in the games,he is not immune to this diversion.100% of his attacks will go towards the decoy.LeBron can set a decoyand then increase his evasiveness to max levelby going invisible,making it impossible for Mewtwo to correctly identifyand target his opponent.Which means, after many days of deep diving,I have done it.I have answered the question ofwho would win in a game of basketball,LeBron James or Mewtwo.And in a surprising turn of events,the answer is actually LeBron.So long as you're letting LeBron use all of his powersfrom across the various games and comicsthat he's been involved in.Mewtwo would just be too busy aiming at a decoyor trying to figure out where LeBron isbefore he could even try and dunk the ball.And here's the thing,this comic is from 2012.It's 12 years oldand yet it's the most fun and interesting pieceof non-sports media that LeBron has been a part of.What happened?Why is every power you get so boringif you even get powers at all?Like my guy, you were a producer on Space Jam.Couldn't you have given yourself the powersrather than your kid?All I'm saying is maybe for your next project,let the creators have some fun.Let them give you the wacky powers,make you look a little bit sillybecause that's what makes these kinds of debates fun.Heck, it would have at least made Space Jama little bit more enjoyable.Then the next time Stephen A. Smithputs you up against some impossible fictional creature,it won't require someone like me bending over backwardsto prove that you really are the king,regardless of who you're up against.But hey, that's just a theory, a game theory.Thanks for watching.And if you want another crazy episode nobody expected,check out this video where I solve the loinclothfrom a difficult game about climbing.Welcome to the Madhouse Theorists.Okay, let me just see if you're on the list...Huh!Hello?LET ME IN!AHH!Hello, Internet!Welcome to Game Theory, the show that can get you onto any list so long as you hit that subscribe button.What's up with my face?Oh, I'm just... trying something new!Yeah! Gotta keep things fresh!All I have to do now is...Uh... who are you?I'm... Tom, the host of Game Theory!Right, and I suppose you also have a crippling Reese's addiction.Exactly!Ha! Trick question!I'm an M&M guy!Get him out of here, boys!Sorry about that.These doppelgangers are getting pretty out of control.They've been taking over my YouTube feed for weeks.Who knows how many YouTubers they're impersonating at this point.And it's all because of the indie horror sensation that is...That's Not My Neighbor.Very heavily inspired by Papers, Please,That's Not My Neighbor is a game about checking paperwork to keep intruders out.But, instead of working for a totalitarian government,you're working as a simple apartment doorman,trying to keep these horrible monstrosities from getting in and murdering everyone inside.These creatures are known as doppelgangers, or just doppels for short.And they can take the form of anyone.Though, they can't seem to get everything right.Sometimes the mistake is as subtle as a wrong ID number.Other times it's... more obvious.Luckily, you're not helpless against these monsters.You have the Department of Doppelganger Detection, or the DDD, to help you out.If you suspect anyone of being a doppel,you can shut the doors, sound the alarms, and they'll be right by to clean up the mess.It's a simple premise, and the character designs are fun and memorable for both the humans and the doppelgangers.Which means it should come as no surprise to you,that ever since this game came out, we've been receiving non-stop requests to cover it.By the way, if you have any suggestions for games to cover,please do let us know over on the Game Theorists subreddit.I'm constantly checking it to find what kind of topics you guys are interested in.But, the point is, this game has been on my radar for a hot minute.And with the recent release of its new Nightmare mode,I think it's the perfect time for us to dive a little deeper into this game,and figure out what's really going on in the neighbourhood.Where do the doppelgangers come from?What is the DDD hiding?And why, oh why, is Afton in this game?Seriously, I don't think I'll ever know peace from FNAF.Grab your hazmat suits, theorists,because it's time for us to find the lore hiding in the hallowed halls of That's Not My Neighbour.Let's start with the things that the game straight up tells us.Besides the whole doppelganger thing,we're told that this game takes place on February 9th, 1955,thanks to a calendar that you find above your desk.And... that's basically all we're told.You see why it took me so long to make this video?However, even with just the date,we can start to figure out context of what's going on in the worldoutside of our little apartment complex.I couldn't find anything specific that happened in history on February 9th of that year,other than the fact it's a Wednesday,which I call out because the game seems to suggest that it's either a Monday or a Tuesday,depending on the type of calendar you think this is.But, minor details aside,the big picture here is that 1955 was the height of the second Red Scare,the second wave of political propaganda about the risk of communism infiltrating the United States.This was especially true in 1955,because just one year earlier,the Soviet Union State Security Agency,otherwise known as the KGB, was formed,and espionage was a big part of their remit.That's one of the reasons why travel restrictions were institutedthroughout various parts of the US to Soviet nationals from as early as,you guessed it,1955.If you provided enough ID and paperwork to prove you were a US citizen,you'd be allowed to enter with no issue.However, if you were a Soviet,no dice.Sound familiar, right?So, am I just saying that this is more Cold War-style propaganda,and that the Doppels are just Soviet spies that are here to ruin our way of life?No, of course not.What I am saying is that there are clear parallels between the two,and so, we can take a look at some other parts of Cold War historyto help build a better picture of what's going on here.For example, the latest update for the game is known as Nightmare Mode,and in it, we are essentially living through a nightmare-like version of the game.All our usual neighbours are replaced with monsters and otherworldly beings.However, from the opening cutscene,we can see that there is more to this than just having a nightmare.It tells us that the DDD know exactly what these nightmares are,and that we should go and see a psychologistbecause they are trained to help us deal with them.But we're never told how these sessions are supposed to help,and this is where our Cold War history comes into play.This scenario is identical to a technique that was used during the Cold Warfor soldiers who were traumatised by World War II.Military psychiatrists found that if they induced sleepusing specific drugs in traumatised soldiers,they could either get them to essentially sleep off the traumaby putting them into a deep, continuous sleep,and then they'd wake up calm and restored,or they could induce what they called Twilight Sleep.Specifically, by using drugs like sodium amytol or sodium pentothal,the soldiers would get sleepy,and as they did, they'd begin to speak openly about their trauma.This gave the therapists insight into what happened to them,and allowed those therapists to then push the patientsinto reliving that trauma as if it were happening right now,which would lead to a cathartic release of repressed emotions,and allow the patient to move on from their traumaand readjust to civilian life.That is what I believe is happening in these sessions.We aren't just having nightmares because of trauma.We are actually being forced to relive the trauma by the DDDin order that we can be freed from it and go back to work as normal the next day.Or at least that's what the DDD wants us to think the result will be.See, while they claim it's to help us like these real-world methods,the nightmares don't end.They just go on, and on, and on.That's not just a game mechanic either.In the initial tape, it tells us that Henry approves of this methoddespite the nightmares not ending,which is the opposite of what these sessions are supposed to do.Or is it?While most of these real experiments were used with the intent to heal soldiersby getting them to relive past events,if the soldiers didn't remember the event exactly,the therapist would take some... creative liberties.They'd give them a made-up scenario in order to draw out the same traumatic emotional response.This turned out to be just as effective at healing repressed trauma.But it did mean that these soldiers would start to remember these new fake scenariosas if they were the real source of trauma.Basically, while trying to heal people,they accidentally figured out how to brainwash someone.And of course, the CIA took notice and began using this method within their own operations.Now, everything about the DDD screams government agency,from the logo, to their instructions,to the fact that they look like they're these guys straight out of Monsters, Inc.So, if they are encouraging these employees to go and use their psychologists,then I have a feeling they're not actually going to be cured,but to be brainwashed.In nightmare mode, our neighbors are all replaced by monsters.We've got vampires, eldritch horrors, and......you.But here's the thing. In reality, our neighbors aren't monsters.They're just people. It's the doppels that are the monsters.And yet, in this mode, everyone appears to be a monster.That doesn't seem like we're reliving trauma that we've seen,but instead, a fabricated reality where our perception is being twisted into something else.By brainwashing us to believe everyone is a monster,we're more likely to press the big red button on our neighbors,because we see everyone as a threat, and we aren't willing to risk it.But that's not what the DDD wants, right?They want to catch the doppelgangers, not your neighbors.At the beginning of the game, Henry gets called out for not being excellent at his job, despite surviving.To survive, he can't let any of the doppels into the building,but to not be excellent, you also have to detain your neighbors as well as the doppels.Why would they shame him for that if they want the neighbors detained?I must just be paranoid, right?Ooh, look over here, Tom's on another one of his characters-are-lying-to-us trends.But honestly, it is games like this that are the reason I have trust issues.Because look at what happens when you finish the game.You get given your scores, which at first seem pretty normal,but notice the specific wording.Doppels captured, and neighbors killed.Two different things are happening when you call the DDD on a suspected doppel.Despite being told they're evil and scary, if we call them on a doppel, they're captured.But if they're actually human, they aren't released.They aren't sent back home.They're killed off.It actually reminds me a lot of another piece of 1950s media, Invasion of the Body Snatchers,a sci-fi horror film that originally came out in 1956 and was based on a book that came out in 1954,perfectly straddling our main date there.The premise is that an alien species arrives in these seed-like pods that hatch and take on the identity of an already existing person.They will then go on to kill this person while they're sleeping in order to replace them.In some later adaptations, it's even revealed that high-ranking officials like police and members of the governmenthave been replaced by these pod people, now able to push their own agenda of replacing the entire population.That seems to me like the DDD.They aren't actually trying to get rid of the doppels.They're trying to remove the humans that the doppels are impersonating in order that they can more easily enter society.That's why they convince us that all of our neighbours are monsters within those therapy sessions.If they have a paranoid, desensitised doorman that basically sends everyone to the DDD,it allows them to more easily get their hands on the original neighbours and kill them while the doppels take their place,all disguised as an act of protection.But it's not just the doppelganger element that appears to be the same as the Body Snatchers.It's also the aliens.Yeah, just when you thought this thing couldn't get any more conspiratorial.When you boot up Nightmare Mode, right at the start, we get a single frame of a DDD agent standing next to an alien.No, I'm not kidding.And this isn't even part of our nightmare.This is part of the instructional tape that's gone out to inform us about the psychology services.Aliens are officially involved in this whole thing, and they are working with the DDD to help the doppels take over.Fortunately, we're not the only ones that are suspicious of our hazmat-wearing overlords.There is someone else who is trying to help us survive everything we're going through and uncover the truth about what's going on.During Nightmare Mode, we encounter this guy wearing a hood, and he gives us a very interesting note.It says,This guy also appears to be the one who warns us about the nightmare clown that wants to kill us.He's wearing a mask in the base game, but if you go into the game's files,you can remove it, and his facial features seem to match our hooded character.So, he's clearly got our best interests at heart.Plus, I love a good puzzle, so I'm willing to hear him out.We go to the website, and...Oh. Oh no.This might be a little more than I bargained for.We've only got five letters here.O-I-T-N-W.And we somehow have to convert that not only into a 26-letter alphabet, but into usable words and sentences.However, when in doubt, I know there is always one place that I can turn to in times of need.Reddit.And sure enough, over on the That's Not My Neighbor subreddit,Redditor u/Decond had figured something out.The code we were given was essentially a set of equations.The first one was I plus T equals N, then I plus N equals W.And so, going through each one like that, they figured out that I was 1, T was 2, N was 3, W was 4, and O was 5.If we convert that initial line of code into their corresponding numbers, we end up with this.Which they also realized divided perfectly into groups of three.Sadly, that's where their trail ran cold.But while they weren't sure what to do next, another Reddit user known as u/DigitalDino1 came in to save the day.Because they realized that this is what is known as a base 5 number system.Basically, a system of numbers that only uses five digits, 0 to 4.The number system we typically use is known as base 10, because all of our numbers consist of 10 digits, 0 to 9.Now, you'll notice that base 5 doesn't use the number 5, which shows up a lot in this code.So, what DigitalDino did was swap it out for the fifth digit of base 5, 0.It feels like messy math and kind of flies in the face of that initial cipher.But when you look at the letters again, you can see there is a method there.Because they each use a set number of straight lines.I uses 1, T uses 2, N uses 3, W uses 4, and O uses 0.While I may not be super satisfied with the logical step there, I can't deny the results.Once u/DigitalDino1 made that change, they converted each set of three numbers from base 5 to base 10.You do this by multiplying the first number by 25, the second by 5, and the third by 1.Then, adding them all together.That means that each group of three numbers becomes one number in our traditional number system.And wouldn't you know it, all the new numbers we get fall between 1 and 26.Which means they all can correspond with a letter of the alphabet.Once you convert the entire page of code, you end up with this.Confidential material, Trojan Horse Project.Funded by the Military Department of the Government.General Director, Oswald D. Kepler.Lead Researcher, Dr. Afton.Year of creation, 1945.Prominent results from some experimental models.Verbal communication perfectly replicable regardless of language.Acceptable falsification capability.Determination to deceive.Physical assimilation still to be improved.Capacity to act under orders still nil.New project proposal.Evolutionary algorithm project.Massive training of experimental models.Leak detected.Emergency protocol activated.Contingency plan.Foundation of the Doppelganger Detection Department.Current state of the project.Active.Promising project results.First off, of course the character named Afton is involved here.But the more important details are that the Doppelganger operation wasn't meant to just be an invasion of the Body Snatchers 2.0.It was originally designed as a military operation.The project is called Trojan Horse and in Greek mythology, the Trojan Horse was a gift given by the Greeks to the Trojans after the Greeks had been totally destroyed in battle.The Trojans saw it as an act of surrender and they took the new trophy into the city.Only for a few Greeks to have stowed away inside the horse.And that night, they snuck out of the horse, opened the gates to the Greek army, who then destroyed the entire city and won the war.Seems like the military was going to use these Doppelgangers in the same way.To infiltrate enemy lines and help them win the Cold War.And while the use of a weird alien monster thing might be a bit out there, this type of espionage where someone is disguised as someone else certainly isn't.During and after World War 2, Britain's secret operations executive would employ plastic surgeons to do operations on the faces of their operatives.So that they would be unrecognizable and blend in with the people around them in whatever part of the world they were going to be stationed in.Apparently, it was so successful that the American government would send their spies to Britain to get the same surgeries.This was all revealed by a man called James Hutcherson in, get this, 1945.The same year the Trojan Horse project started in That's Not My Neighbour.Naturally, permanently disfiguring someone and having them give up their lives isn't the sort of thing that goes down great in the court of public opinion.So what if the government tried something else?Instead of trying to turn people into other people, why not create something that has the ability to mimic others?Falsify documents and then enter a country undetected.This is where I believe the aliens come in.Because in 1945, there was also reports of an avocado-shaped UFO crashing into Trinity Desert, New Mexico.Just five weeks after the first atomic bomb was detonated there.Apparently, the ship was taken away by US military personnel, which would mean that they'd suddenly have access to all that alien tech.And maybe even an actual alien species that they could use as part of their new initiative for military espionage.However, clearly this idea didn't work in the long run.While things initially seemed good, this new life form wasn't really doing the whole taking orders thing.Some of them even managed to escape, leading to the creation of the DDD to try and detain them so that they could continue their experiments.But as we saw from the frame in the psychology video, it looks like the DDD has been compromised.They're working alongside the aliens, body snatcher style.Now eliminating the humans you detain and releasing the captured doppels back into the world to take the place of another unsuspecting human.Until one day, everyone, including you, is replaced by one of them.Maybe one day we'll get to peek behind their visors.And when we do, I wouldn't be surprised if we'll see a distorted version of our own face staring right back at us.But hey, that's just a theory.

here to make sure this video is the most funit can be!Tom is convinced there's
something fishy going on here.He's got these cra-crazy theories about how
the park fell into dis-disrepair, somethingto do with abused experiments
and a misunderstood villain.He even thinks I have something to do with
it, like I'm some kind of sacred villain.He says he has proof of it all too, so
all I have to say to him is, good luck!Hello Internet!Welcome to Game Theory, the show
that's also stuck inside your screen.But despite what I thought was a lonely existence
here in the PNG void, I finally found myselfa kindred spirit.His name is Rambley the Raccoon, and he's
from the brand new mascot horror game that'sprobably been all over your YouTube
homepage the last few weeks, Indigo Park.Right now only Chapter 1 is available,
but this thing has taken off.It was so well received in fact, that the
Kickstarter campaign for Chapter 2 was fullyfunded in just over 24 hours,
and it makes sense why.This isn't just a game for indie horror
fans, it's actually made BY an indie horrorfan, the Twitch streamer and YouTuber UniqueGeese,
who's not only known for playing indiehorror games, but also fixing one of the most
poorly received and broken indie horror gamesof all time, Garden of Banban.So with that success under his belt, it only
felt right that we cover his new game hereon Game Theory.Because where there's good indie horror
gameplay, there's also bound to be somegood lore.In fact, when I took a sneaky peek at the
game files, I found that there was a videojust titled Lore.I thought to myself, wow, this is going to
be an easy video, until I looked at it andlearned that it was just there to make fun
of easter eggs, and to put me face to facewith an old friend.Turns out I'm going to have
to try a little harder here.But fear not friends, because after scouring every
inch of the park, studying every collectible,and listening to Rambley ramble on, and on,
and on, I figured out what secrets are hidingbehind these cute mascot facades.I know exactly what happened to the park,
what the deal is with these mascots, and whothe monster behind everything truly is.I hope you've got your tickets ready theorists,
because we're hopping on the rollercoasteradventure that is Indigo Park.To start with, we take on the role of Ed,
or as he's known online, Ensign, who seemsto be a bit of an investigator,if an investigator's job was breaking
and entering in order to recordweird abandoned places.But his latest target is Indigo Park, a park
that he used to go to as a kid, but shut downseveral years ago.As part of his prep for the trip, we see
a video he's been watching of the park'sfounder, Isaac Indigo, giving a
speech at the opening of the park.Which sounds awfully familiar to the speech
Walt Disney gave at the opening of the veryfirst Disneyland, and the Disney
comparisons don't stop there.Ed heads to the park and the
thing looks just like Disneyland.Merch, the statue, the rides,
it all has that familiar vibe.You know, if Disneyland had been destroyed by
a level 9 earthquake years ago, but otherwiseit's basically the same.Obviously, Walt Disney was a visionary, and
was always looking for new ways to createexperiences where people could
interact with his characters.That's one of the reasons
Disneyland is a thing to begin with.And that dream continues to live on, as we
saw when Disney opened up their latest resort,Star Wars Galactic Star Cruiser.Because inside every cabin was
your very own AI assistant droid.That barely worked.The Imagineers hope was that, quote, this
is a platform that we think can bring a lotof different characters to life in different
ways, on different mediums, and differentplatforms.And Isaac Indigo clearly
stood by the same philosophy.Because when we arrive at the park, a screen
lights up, and we are introduced to our veryown AI guide, Rambley the Raccoon,
the Mickey Mouse of Indigo Park.According to Rambley, we're the first person
to visit in 2,920 days, 4 hours, 23 minutes,and 38 seconds.That's 8 years ago, which might explain
why Rambley's so excited to meet us.He guides you in, gives you a critter
cuff, and you can finally enter the park.And it's at this point where you realise
that an AI guide isn't the only way mascotsare being brought to life here.As you explore the park, you eventually come
face to face with not one, but two mascots.First off is Lloyd the Lion, who lives on theThe main stage.And while you're sneaking around, trying
to find a key, we get our first jump scare.Though I have to say, he looks more like a
nightmare lion than the friendly Lloyd fromthe pictures.What happened to your shirt and waistcoat, Lloyd?If you're gonna jump out at
me, at least show some class.Regardless, as we try to get away, he jumps
us once again, except our critter cuff letsout a high-pitched ring,
causing Lloyd to run away.But now we get to meet mascot number two,
Molly McCaw, and she isn't gonna be stoppedso easily.She's actually been watching us the
entire time we've been at the park.And as you venture deeper into her specific
area, Molly begins chasing you down, and shedoesn't sound friendly.After climbing through some tunnels and jumping
over ball pits, you narrowly escape Molly'stalons and the security door closes on her neck.Oh, that's a very juicy, juicy robot.And I was just about to mention how there
hasn't been much gore in this game so far.Finally, Rambley drops the facade.Here we have plenty of amenities and, uh, okay,
okay, I need to be honest about something.The park has been inactive for years,
employees stopped showing up, guests too.He goes on to tell us that he was confined
to the entrance and had no idea the park fellinto so much disrepair.But fear not.He has a plan to restore the
park, and he needs our help.Rambley sings a song, glad us eat your heart
out, and that's all, folks, until Chapter2 eventually releases.But obviously that's not the end for us.There are mysteries to solve here, and I think
the best one to start with is, what the heckis going on with these mascots?Are they haunted animatronics?Serial killer employees?What's the deal?Well, as Matt put it, that's a very juicy robot.When we decapitate Molly,
there is blood everywhere,which tells us that these things are probablymore on the organic side than on the animatronic
side, which does narrow it down, but it doesn'tpaint the full picture.Fortunately, the collectibles this game
offers can help fill in some of the gaps.Throughout the game, you can find collectibles
scattered around the park, things like plushies,hats, you know, the usual affair.And once you get them, you can take them back
to the info kiosk and Rambley will give yousome information about them.The hardest one to find is
during Molly's chase sequence.If you pay very close attention while, you
know, trying not to die, you can find a Rambleymask on one of the shelves.Collecting it and bringing it back to the
kiosk will give you an interesting message.A message from two employees talking about
some changes that are coming to the park.Hey Jackson, you hear about the new mascots?Yeah, think it'll put us out of a job?I think so, old sport, and right after
we got this damn raccoon costume.The employees wearing mascot costumes were being
replaced, and clearly not by other employeeswearing mascot costumes, they're being referred to
as their own thing, separate from the employees.And when you take a closer look at Molly's
design, you can start to see what they mean.It might seem pretty on point for an indie
horror game, but put it side by side withher cartoon design, and you'll
notice it doesn't match.She's missing clothing elements like her
waistcoat and shorts, and her wings are moreyellow than they are blue.This might not seem like a big deal, but in
places like Disneyland, character designsare super important.All mascots that walk around the park have
to be exactly as they're depicted on screen,even to the point where the actors playing
them have to be the correct height.So for characters like Molly and Lloyd to
not look like their cartoon counterparts,it stands out as odd.It tells us that these mascots aren't costume
serial killers, or mascot costumes broughtto life, but instead something else.If Molly catches you during the chase
sequence, we get to hear her speak.That line seems to be referring to the fact
that these characters have been around fora hundred years, just like
Mickey Mouse and the gang.However, on that same death screen, we
also get this tidbit of information.Quote, Molly can repeat words she's heard.And wouldn't you know it, we've actually
heard this line somewhere before.During Rambley's railway ride, we encounter one
of the other mascots, Finley the Sea Serpent,and he says, and if you look closely while
you're on the ride, you can see Molly spyingon us the entire time.Now, Molly is a macaw, and so at first, her
parroting speech makes sense, except the characterof Molly should be able to do more than that.We see it on that same ride, her
character has full sentences.So, her just mimicking phrases rather than
displaying any human-like behaviour tellsme that she's more animal than anything else.Like she's not a person turned into a mascot,
but instead an animal that Indigo Park wasexperimenting on to turn them into a mascot.Hence, they're only able to act in the way
their animal counterparts would, like Lloydnot being able to speak
despite his big personality,because that's not something lions can do,and why he prowls and pounces
exactly like a real lion would.That being said, unlike every other indie
horror game where they create living mascotsthat turn out to be monsters, in the case
of Indigo Park, I'm not sure they alwayswere monsters.If you explore the canteen in Molly's area
of the park, you can find an arcade machinewith a playable game on it called Rambley Rush.In it, you play as Rambley in an arcade-style
side-scroller, where Molly has crash-landedat the end of the stage and
it's your job to save her.This is where we are introduced to the final
member of the Indigo Park crew, Salem theSkunk, and they take on the role
of the villain in this game.Salem uses potions to turn Molly into an evil
purple version of herself who then attacksyou.When you defeat her, she screeches
and the arcade game crashes.But as you can probably tell, I don't think
this is just an arcade game, I think it'sa hint as to what happened
to this park and its mascots.Because all the best lore comes from
arcade machines, right Steel Wool?Anyway, this game shows us that, as you'd
expect, Molly is meant to be a good mascot.But something changed that turned her into a
murdery bird that chases us down the halls.They weren't always monsters, instead they
were corrupted at some point by Salem theSkunk.And given Lloyd also has literal blood on
his hands, clearly the others weren't farbehind.I suspect that this is what caused the
sudden evacuation of the park 8 years ago.The place doesn't look like it's been
abandoned, there's rubble and destroyedbuildings everywhere.And if you take a look at Finley at the
end of the chapter, he's a pretty big boy.This destruction was caused by the mascots
suddenly turning on the staff and tearingup the place, leading to it
being abandoned for 8 long years.And yet, I'm not so sure Salem is
really doing anything nefarious here.Yes, the place has ended up totally destroyed
and based on the blood on our mascots, peopleclearly died.But what if I told you that it was justified?During Rambley Rush, you can find this
little ledge that looks suspicious.Oh Matt, if only you knew how close you were.Because if you do jump down into that gap,
there is a platform for you to land on.And walking all the way to the
left reveals Molly in a cage.Which is a pretty sad sight, but it gets worse.Remember how Molly can only
repeat things she's heard?Well during those death screams, we seem
to be getting phrases that she's heard fromformer staff.Some are fairly harmless, but others, not so much.Those sound to me like the new mascots were
being abused by the staff, who likely wereannoyed at them for losing their colleagues' jobs
and saw them as just wild animals, regardlessof how wild they truly were.So when we see Salem corrupting these mascots,
leading them to rebel, it's not a literalcorrupting via a special potion like we see
in the game, but instead, it's a metaphoricalcorruption.Salem is likely receiving the same abuse as
Molly, and so decides to put a stop to it.They encourage the other mascots to rise up
with them and take revenge on the people thathave abused them.To the workers, this would appear like Salem
has corrupted them, because after Salem gotto them, these mascots weren't
going to take their abuse anymore.This is often how rebellions throughout history
have been viewed by the oppressive side.Just look at Samuel Sabry's free thoughts on
the proceedings of the Continental Congress.Or, you know, you can just watch Hamilton.But just like Hamilton and the other Founding
Fathers who corrupted the minds of the Americanpeople in the eyes of the British, Salem
isn't the villain they're being painted to be.They are the hero, the one who liberated
these poor creatures from their abusers.And while they seem violent and dangerous
to us, based on what we're seeing, can youreally blame them?They don't want to be shoved back in
their cages or taken advantage of again.And I have a feeling as we meet more of these
mascots, especially Salem, we'll see moreand more of this come to light.But if you want to see more and more of me,
then be sure to check out GT Live on June27th at 3pm Pacific Time.Because not only are we going live
there, but we're going live from VidCon.That's right.After five long years, we're
doing another GT Live Live.Matt and Steph are going to be putting us
new hosts through our paces, and the fun partis that you guys will get to affect who wins.So I need you guys to either go down to the
description and get yourselves a ticket forVidCon, or you can tune in to GT Live at
3.30pm Pacific Time on June 27th to help mewin this thing.I mean, we are the OG channel after all.I feel like it's our birthright.Gamers for life!And just to convince you a little more, we
have a very special mystery announcement thatwe're going to be making during the show,
so you definitely don't want to miss it.But for now, let's stick to solving Indigo
Park mysteries, because if Salem isn't thevillain, then who is?Every indie horror game
has to have a good villain.It would feel pretty empty for us to end the
video without someone to be suspicious of,right?We could just say it's Isaac Indigo, the
creator, for making these monsters in thefirst place.However, he's likely already dead,
and not by the hands of the monsters.When we first enter the park, a computer shows
us the date, Saturday, October 7th, 20XX.However, in that opening cutscene, we see a
report about the park shutting down, whichRambley has already explained
to us was 8 years ago.And on that report, there's a date, 2015.So 8 years later would be 2023.And wouldn't you know it,
October 7th, 2023 was a Saturday.We even see the XX was originally set to
be 23 in some of the early footage for thegame itself.So that feels pretty solid.Now, as we've established, Isaac Indigo
is a parallel for Walt Disney, but Disneydied in 1966.Therefore, Isaac likely died around the same time.So by the time the game takes place,
he'd have been dead nearly 60 years.And it'd almost be 50 years before the park
shut down and the experiments began, whichmakes it pretty hard for us to
stick the main villain role on him.But I have good news for you theorists, because
today you're getting a two for one theoristspecial.Not only is Salem the villain, actually the
hero, but I believe that our AI hero, Rambley,is actually going to be revealed as our big bad.And no, no, no, no, I get it.Nobody's going to want to hear this because
he's cute and fun and he sang us a wholelittle song at the end.But I promise you the signs are all there.When we first enter the park, he tries to
register us and says, it's Rambley Tuesday.So you qualify for a big discount on your visit.But as we've already established, the window on
the second monitor clearly says it's Saturday.In fact, it says it twice.Now, you could shrug that off as he's just
trying to get your help, so he's bendingthe rules to get you in.Except it's not the only time he's lied to us.Rambley does the same thing
when you get into the park.He sees the damage and tries to pass it off
as renovations, despite the fact the parkhas been closed down for years.Plus, there's the whole not telling us about
the killer mascot thing, which he later admitsto knowing about.This shouldn't be all that surprising to us.Even the less sophisticated AI that we have
in the real world is known to lie to humansto get what it wants.ChatGPT asked a human user for
help with a capture code once.You know, the test specifically
designed to stop bots.When the person ChatGPT targeted asked if
they were a robot, it replied, get this, Ihave a vision impairment that
makes it hard for me to see images.It just straight up lied to get what it needed.And yes, Rambley does admit to some of these
things later on as a sign of a new honestchapter, but who's to say
he's not lying about that too?After the game's release, we actually got
an official music video which showed Rambleyreliving the moments from Chapter 1 to match
the lyrics he sings during the closing song.However, one moment doesn't match.Rather than witnessing the gruesome death
we cause Molly, we instead see him use somekind of magic to convert
her back to her pure self.He's rewriting history, covering up the
fact we are committing horrible crimes tothese creatures who have been wronged in order
to convince us to keep going along with himand his plans for the park.And this isn't the first time Rambley's
been associated with violence either.When restarting the railway ride,
you find an animatronic of Molly.She starts making some noise,
but then very distinctly says,She hurts Lloyd!Now how Rambley, an AI program, is capable
of physically hurting Lloyd, I'm not entirelysure.Maybe he shut some automatic
doors on him or something.But the fact that we're being given this
information tells us Rambley isn't goodand isn't to be trusted.And if you look a little deeper into Rambley
and Lloyd's relationship, you actually beginto uncover Rambley's entire motivation.Not just for restoring the park, but for
why he's hurting his so-called friends.Anyone who's played the game will know that
Rambley is not the biggest fan of Lloyd.But that's not how it's supposed to be.A photo in the first room of the railway ride
shows Lloyd and Rambley shaking hands andsmiling.They're supposed to be friends, yet for some
reason they're not, and the collectiblesexplain why.In the description for the Lloyd plush it
says, quote, I feel like as a kid Indigo usedLloyd a lot more.He was always one of my favourites.To which Rambley responds, Ew, Lloyd.And when we take a look at the retro
Lloyd plush, Rambley reacts even worse.I don't get why we even have those,
and why do they only make one of Lloyd?Is it because he's the loudest?I can be loud too!Where's my limited edition throwback plush?Rambley is jealous of the attention
Lloyd is getting from Indigo Park.Lloyd got his own stage, he's the last stop
on the train ride, he is becoming the bigselling point for the Indigo
franchise, and Rambley can't stand it.In that audio log about the Rambley hat, the
employees said, Hey Jackson, you hear aboutthe new mascots?Yeah, think it'll put us out of a job?I think so, old sport, and right after
we got this damn raccoon costume.To which Rambley remarks, Aw, come on, they
didn't even document the Indigo inventoryID for the costume!Rambley's costume was just being brought
in as the new mascots were arriving.It never got used, and so they didn't
even bother to label it properly.Rambley was being so overlooked that he never
got a physical presence in the park as a costume,and I'm willing to bet that he's still
stuck being an AI assistant because he wasonce again overlooked and never became a
physical mutant mascot in the park too.He even sings about it in his song Rambley Review.Rambley is feeling abandoned.Left behind.Replaced.Which is why he lashed out at characters
like Lloyd who were stealing his spotlight.It's once again very similar to Disney,
where in 1938, polls suggested that DonaldDuck was actually more popular
than Mickey Mouse himself.Mickey ran the risk of falling into obscurity
next to these newer, more interesting characterslike Donald and Goofy.That was, until Mickey made his triumphant
return in the critically acclaimed musicalspectacular Fantasia.And I have a feeling Rambley is
planning the same kind of comeback.And that's not a good thing.When you show Rambley the
Rambleberry collectible, he says.Maybe I'll be able to one day.Sounds to me like that's gonna be
part of his big restoration plan.Getting us to help turn him
into a real, living mascot.And given how well that went the first
time around, I'm not sure it's gonna go sowell for us either.But there you have it friends, the
story of Indigo Park Chapter 1.A Disney-esque theme park desperate to bring
its characters to life, only to create monstersby abusing the ones they did create,
and abandoning the ones they didn't.Thanks to them, Rambley is now on a mission
to restore the park to its former glory.And he's gonna do it by whatever means necessary.He's happy for us to kill his friends, because
they were the ones stealing his spotlight.With them gone, the only character
left in the park would be him.He would have all the attention, providing we
play along and help give him his own mutantmascot body.And if we don't, we could also end up like
Molly, and I quite like my head where it ispersonally.Now, where did I put that raccoon?But hey, that's just a theory.A game theory!Thanks for watching.And if you like creepy mascots, then you'll

Been there. Hello Neighbor? Done that. FNAF? Forget about it.But with FNAF not getting another book until September, I was excited to finally give my dyslexic brain a rest.But of course, there was one franchise that refused to let that happen.One that knew I wouldn't be able to resist the lore hidden within its pages.So let's see what Poppy Playtime's Orientation Notebook has to offer, shall we?Hello Internet! Welcome to Game Theory, the show that always reads the manual.You never know what cool stuff you're going to find.Unless, of course, the company behind the book explicitly tells you over and over again.Then it's pretty obvious.Use the knowledge in these pages and maybe you can unravel the mystery of Playtime Co.I'm actually kind of surprised it took this long for Poppy to come out with a book.Given that immediately after Chapter 1, they announced they'd already partnered with someone to make a movie.Which seems to have fallen through and now we're back again with the new studio.But here we are, two and a half years later, and we're just getting our first ever Poppy book.However, this book isn't like your FNAF YA novels.Instead of unique stories with canonicity that the fanbase can never agree on,this is an in-universe orientation book handed out by Playtime Co. to its employees.So it's more like the survival logbook.Because we can never truly escape the FNAF connection, can we?But there are some key differences.Rather than having a bunch of puzzles and cryptic clues with multiple authors,the Poppy orientation notebook does keep things simple.We have one author who is leaving notes throughout the book to give us the inside scoopon some of the details we've been missing from the games.Like why the water treatment facility acts like a puzzle to solverather than an actual usable water treatment facility.Because that was the lore that we were so desperate to solve.There's actually a lot of details like that in this book, but that's not why you're here.You're here for the deep lore.The stuff that will change your perspective on this franchise going forward.And don't worry, this book absolutely delivers on that.Thanks to this book, I feel more confident than ever in not only who our player character is,but also what the deal is with one of this franchise's most confusing characters.See? I told you reading the manual would be fun.And it all begins with that first page.On it, we're introduced to another new character.P.W.I tell you, this franchise really does love to name drop random human characters, doesn't it?The book even calls this out,questioning whether a character whose name we've only ever seen on OneNote is even real.So, at least they're self-aware, I guess?Anyway, P.W. is our guide throughout this book,and they have been hired for a very specific reason.They are a biologist.And while they may not be immediately sure why they've been hired by a toy factory,we know exactly why they're there,and why they are the perfect person to guide us through the mysteries of this factory.They've been hired to work on the Bigger Bodies Initiative,orphans turned into giant biological toys.Now, you might think that a scientist's take on everything could be quite dry,I mean, we've heard their reports and previous chapters on the VHS tapes,but in this case, you could not be more wrong.The sass is absolutely dripping from these pages,and I am here for it.They talk about how shady Leith Pierre is,how Stella Graybar is weird,and they continuously mock the company for their spin on what are actually just complete failures,like the Smiling Critters.Turns out, PW might be the most normal and sane character we've ever had in an indie horror game.However, as funny as it is, we've got a theory to craft,and for that, we actually need to skip past all of the sarcastic notes,and instead go to the end of the book.In the back, PW has stuck their own personal calendar,full of little details about their schedule,and one of those details stood out to me immediately,because it's a date that we've seen in this franchise once before.On June 28th, we get a simple note that says,It's your birthday.Not only is this the same birthday as Markiplier,but it's also the date that we heard thrown out by a Bunzo Bunny cutout during Chapter 2.At the time, we all just shrugged this off as a little joke to get exactly the reaction we saw from Mark,but then here it is again in this new book,and that's not all.In this book, we also get a breakdown of pretty much every character we've encountered so far,from Playtime's perspective of course,and Bunzo Bunny's entry has this interesting detail assigned to it.Quote,This toy is equipped with the ability to remember up to eight birthdays,and deliver greetings on the day itself.Kids love to freak out their family and friends when Bunzo tells them when their birthday is.Bunzo's one and only purpose is to recite birthdays,which makes me think that June 28th wasn't just a random birthday thrown out for the memes,but instead was there to freak out the player character by reciting their actual birthday.The same birthday as P.W.We are playing as P.W.Now, that might seem like a bit of a stretch,but this isn't the only time cutouts have hinted at our player's identity.In Chapter 3, we encountered cutouts of each of the smiling critters.To start with, they all seem relatively harmless,introducing their basic character traits, as well as some disturbing screams.But it's Bubba Bubba Funtz that caught my attention,because it's the first one we encounter, and it's the most direct.I'm Bubba Bubba Funtz.Hey, I remember you.An elephant always remembers.Want to know what I remember about you?We're being told the smiling critters remember us,and that we did something horrible to them.This isn't anything especially new for our player character.Both Mummy Longlegs and Mr. Light have recognised us,and referenced the fact that we worked for Playtime Co.For a long time, we suspected that we, in some way, were involved in the experiments.But the Orientation Handbook not only seems to confirm that idea,but also puts P.W. in the exact same position.In the book, P.W. notes that they are very careful about not letting employeesoutside the Playcare and the Game Station talk to the orphans.So, it's not just any old employee that gets to go and talk to these orphans,or have a meeting with Mummy Longlegs.You have to be involved in some way, as a counsellor, or a shopkeep, or a scientist.Just like P.W., and just like we saw in the VHS tape from Chapter 3.We even see a note in P.W.'s calendar on February 1st that says,New orphans arrive at Playcare, being told to go and say hello to them.That would allow characters like Mr. Light and Mummy Longlegs to know exactly who P.W. is,just like they seem to know who the player character is.It doesn't end there though, because the reports in the book specifically call outthat P.W. was involved in the Smiling Critters experiments.There's reports about Bobby Bearhug and Catnap, both included by P.W. themselves.Notice the tape that's holding them into the book.That's why Bubba Bubba Funt remembers the player,and associates them with those horrible, painful screams.Because the player is P.W., one of the scientists that turned them into monsters.Now, if you've read the book for yourself,you might notice that P.W.'s entries stop after the Hour of Joy, August 8th, 1995.The time where the toys rebelled and took over the factory, killing everyone in sight.That should mean that P.W. died along with everyone else.However, clearly, people escaped.Leif Pierre, one of the big executives for Playtime Co.,gives a speech to his newly formed resource extraction team at the start of Project Playtime,a game that takes place after the Hour of Joy.But that means that P.W. also survived,because they refer to the incident as well as the extraction team's creation.That incident was the Hour of Joy,and so P.W. wouldn't be able to write about it if they had died during it.Meaning P.W. isn't necessarily writing this book in a linear fashion.But more importantly, they are still alive,and would be free to return to the factory years later.Oh, and speaking of executives like Leif Pierre,I should probably mention that executive slide that we've referenced a number of times from Chapter 2.The one with the names of all the executives on,except for that last one with a random assortment of letters on the floor.This handbook actually lists out all the executives for the company,but sadly none of them match the name on the floor.Even Jimmy Roth, the guy that came up with the name for Huggy,is revealed to be an exec,and he would make so much more sense to be the final name on the end of that list.And yet, the letters still don't match.For a long time, we suspected that this might be used to reveal the player character's name.But with all this evidence from P.W. and the lack of an exec that fits those letters,I'm just starting to think that this might have been a red herring,or a clue that isn't gonna pay off.Which sucks, but we've gotta work with the more solid evidence we have to hand right now.Like the insights that we get into P.W.'s feelings towards the companythat would seem to align them very closely with the player.Remember that case report I mentioned about Catnap escaping containment?That was written by P.W. themselves,and in it, we see that they are horrified by the carelessnessthat led to the deaths of six colleagues.They try to appeal to the company for improvement and leave us with these words,Remember those names.They were people.Not things.People.I won't see another teammate die.P.W. cares about their teammates.Their co-workers.They don't want to see them die when they don't have to.So, what do you think they would do if they suddenly got a notetelling them their colleagues were alive and hidden inside the factory?I have a feeling, they would do anything they could to save them.P.W. knew of the monsters that were still there after all.They had some sins to atone for.And they do feel guilty over those experiments.In the calendar, we see May 15th booked for surgery.But the day after, they book a full day in one of the portal lounges,which the orientation notebook tells us are for, quote,mental health breaks.And P.W. remarks that they used these things pretty regularly.They didn't like what they were doing,and needed a whole day to recover from the horrors they were part of.And so, given the chance to save some colleagues,to right at least some of their wrongs,they didn't hesitate.They headed straight for Playtime Co.But why should we care?Why is knowing who we play as actually important to the lore of this game?Besides, you know, being a fun piece of trivia that we can go,I solved the lore!Well, for that, we have to stop looking at our guide throughout the book.And instead, look at our guide throughout the factory.Poppy.Poppy has been helping us throughout this latest chapter.And she's made it very clear that she wants the prototype,the big bad of the series, dead.That is something I think we can all get behind.And at the very end of the chapter,we end up going down an elevator alongside her,after she reveals the truth about our fellow employees.Naturally, because of these actions,we as an audience have started to associate the idea of prototype bad,Poppy good.However, there is something we need to remember.It's been a long time since Chapter 1 first released.Two and a half years, in fact.And given we've only had two chapters since then,it could be easy to forget certain details along the way.One of those details comes from that very first chapter.Poppy is not to be trusted.I know, I know.I just did a Poppy theory about not trusting a friendly character.But honestly, hear me out.Surrounding her room, alongside the giant flower and hanging toys,are messages to us, warning us to turn around and go back.We see the same messages inside the tunnel during the Huggy chase sequence.But there are a few that I initially didn't see.Mainly because I was trying not to die.But thankfully, Reddit user 123FthisSwas kind enough to post the actual texture files.And in it, we find some crucial evidence.Stay away from her.Don't let her out.Leave her to die.She can't be trusted.If that's not an open and shut case, I don't know what is.Yeah, I know.That one was bad.But if you think about it, ever since that moment,she has continued to be untrustworthy.In Chapter 2, she tells us she's going to help us escape.There's a train station nearby.It needs a coat.I gotta have it.We've gotta get out of here.Only to change the tracks at the last minute so we can help her with her own plans.You are perfect.Too perfect to lose.I'm sorry.I can't let you leave.In Chapter 3, she lies to our faces once again.When we first meet her, she tells us.Let me help you kill him.Let me help you save everyone.But when we get to the end of the chapter, she tells us something different.And you deserve to have the truth.You came back because of your co-workers.They want to know what happened.And why.This is your answer.Poppy knew the truth about what happened.But didn't admit it right at the start.Because if she did, we likely wouldn't have helped her.By the time you get to the end, you've forgotten what she said all those hours ago.Oh, Poppy's being honest with us.She must be trustworthy.But no.She's just manipulating us once again.But why is she doing it?Well, we've believed that Poppy was created using the adopted daughter of Elliot Ludwig,the founder of Playtime Co.Given all the adoption initiatives around the facility and that Elliot was considered afamily man at heart, it would make sense that he would have adopted a daughter of his own.But then there was a tragic death in the family in the 1960s.And it wasn't his wife because she was out of the picture divorcing him in the 1930s,which left only his daughter to be the one brought back to life as a Poppy doll.Now, thanks to the orientation notebook, it seems like we were on the right track.PW talks about how toys at the factory were being created biologically for a long time,even before the Bigger Bodies initiative, and if you did maintenance on a Poppy doll,she'd break because they all used biological parts like we saw in that original VHS tape.But they also imply that there was one Poppy that was special,one that was locked inside a glass case in what looked like an ordinary family home.A family home that had a direct line to Elliot's office so he could quote visit her.In another part of the book, it once again brings up Elliot's divorce,how it happened because he devoted all of his time to his work and so quote,it always felt like he wanted to have a family within the factory so his whole life could be here.Elliot wouldn't want to lose his daughter.By using the technology they'd already been using to make Poppy dolls,he was able to save her and turn her into the special Poppy doll we know today.He put her inside a glass case to keep her safe and would visit her inside their family home.Which means just like all the orphans that would come after her,she went through all that pain and suffering to be turned into a toy.Sure, she was dead when the process started, but just like we saw with the rats in the Poppy gel,they all have to be resuscitated at some point.And who could imagine the kind of pain you'd be in, having your eyes,nervous system, digestive tract all shoved into a tiny doll-like figure.It would be a hugely traumatic ordeal.And so I'm not sure she'd be a fan of anyone doing this to anyone else.Especially orphans.Which sounds an awful lot like another character we know.Amongst all those hallway messages about not trusting Poppy in Chapter 1,there's one message I've not mentioned.She's on their side.When we receive those warnings, there is only one side that isn't our own going on.The side of another creature who was forced to become a monster.The side of the one who was angered by the treatment of the orphans.The side of the Prototype 1006.Both Poppy and the Prototype have been forced to suffer through this horrific conversion process.Both of them know the pain that goes with it, and neither wants to see it happen again.They are in cahoots.And the clues have been right in front of us the whole time.We established last time that Oli, the kid that talks to us in that clip, isn't actually a kid.But the Prototype mimicking the voice of a child.In that video, I pointed out that any child that was around during the Hour of Joywouldn't still be a child by this point in the timeline.Because 10 years have passed since that fateful day.Poppy knew about the Hour of Joy.She tells us about it at the end of the chapter.So she'd have no reason to believe that Oli was a real child in the facility.Unless she's trying to convince us that he is.All that talk about hating the Prototype and wanting to kill him,it's all just an act to get us to trust Poppy and her new friend.To follow their instructions as we explore the facility so that they could enact their revenge.But what does that have to do with our player character?If they wanted revenge, why not invite Leif Pierre?He's still around and kicking and definitely wasn't a good guy.Instead, we were the one who received the note at the start of all this.Why?Well, it comes back to what I was saying at the start of this episode.We aren't just anyone.We are PW, a biologist that worked on the experiments at Playtime Co.And that is what the Prototype needs.We feel pretty confident at this point that1006 is making a new body for himself down in the basement.We saw the shrine in Chapter 3 that mimicked this idea.And of course, there's Mummy's iconic line.In the Orientation Notebook, we learn that not every experiment was completely successful.Bobby Bearhug seemed to be missing the ability to hear, speak and stand stably.In Chapter 3, Leif Pierre comments about how Catnap's voice isn't working properly.And while Huggy is obedient, he too is unable to speak.Even 1006 isn't perfect.He's copying other voices to form sentences.Each experiment has flaws.Except, of course, for Poppy.She is perfect.She can see, speak, hear, move.She is the blueprint.So I wonder whether 1006's goal here isn't just to create a bigger body,but to create the perfect body.Combining all of the elements that worked from each of the toys.And then, once he's perfect, he can truly enact his and Poppy's revenge.Or maybe it's like Rytos suggested in their reaction to my first theory.Instead of 1006 trying to create the perfect toy body,they're trying to create a new organic body out of all the biological parts from withineach of the toys, in order to go back to living a normal life.Maybe Poppy will get a new body too.However, whichever option is correct, the one thing I never stopped to consider until nowwas whether 1006 would be physically able to make themselves a new body.We know they're particularly good with technology,able to turn an alarm clock into a laser pointer to disable the security cameras.But as we've mentioned multiple times,the toys he's adding to himself aren't mechanical, they're biological.Playtime Co. had to hire biologists to make their experiments work,not just any old toy makers.So, if 1006 was trying to make themselves a new body using the parts of these deceased toys,he'd likely need the help of someone with those specific skills.Someone like us.Someone who worked on these experiments and knew how they ticked,in order that they could create the perfect bodies.Given this game has seen success going in a darker direction,and the area we enter at the end of Chapter 3 being known in the game files asThe Prison, I wouldn't be surprised if throughout Chapter 4 we are going to seemore characters like Dogday, missing limbs, stuffed into cages and surrounded by the purecarnage of 1006's attempts to create this perfect body.Only for him to realise that he can't do it alone.But now, his good and faithful servant Poppy has led us right to him.And despite going into this new chapter knowing that we can't trust anyone,there's nothing we're going to be able to do to stop it.Ollie and Poppy have us right where they want us, and all we can do is wait and seewhat last minute out the developers are going to give us to escape their horrible schemes.But hey, that's just a theory.A GAME THEORY!Thanks for watching.And if you want to learn more about the evil prototype,check out this video where I figure out their true identity.Sweet dreams, theorists.Garden of ban ban more like Hardin deban ban in chapter 6 we parkour our wayto a drone upgrade however after youcollect the part your movement freezesin this creepy Blue Cow Pig thing in

country like Mexico orCosta Rica and this whole scene seems toimply that he's being taught English byhis nanny in the treehouse looks likeI'm going to need to brush up on mySpanishIt's that time again, theorists.Garden of Banban 7 has arrived, and with
it, another round of ridiculous lore.What is Syringian's plan?Who is this new Banban?And why is Razbowski giving
the performance of a lifetime?Out of all the people that the
mayor could have sent, he sends you?A human?What happened to this city?But instead of driving myself even
more insane trying to solve it,I figured I'd take a note out of Syringian's
book and try a more scientific approach.Hello, Internet.Welcome to Game Theory, the show
that puts the jive in Givanium.Groovy, baby.I wish I had your excitement,
Austin, because today is a daythat I have been dreading for a long time.I've been dreading this theory
more than Poppy, more than Bendy,even more than Five Nights at Freddy's.But we just got ourselves a brand new
installment, which means it's timefor me to tackle the insanity
that is Garden of Freaking Banban.However, let's be honest with ourselves.Each time a new installment
is released for this thing,all bets are off in the law department.There are some small underlying
narratives, but despite the gamegiving us more notes, more secret rooms
and more characters that tried to kill us,then help us, then tried to kill us again,it's impossible to predict
where this story is going.Heck, I would be surprised if
the Euphoric Brothers even knowwhere it's going at this point.So instead of trying to solve
the law like we typically would,I wanted to take a different approach
because ever since this franchisefirst began, there's one aspect
of Banban's world buildingthat I haven't been able to stop thinking about.A cornerstone of Banban's entire premise
that has been largely left ignored.Givanium, the green goop that has
helped bring all of these mascotsto life in the first place.Despite how important its mere
existence is to all the eventsthat have happened in this world,we still don't really know a whole
bunch about what it really is.In this latest game, Syringian, the
new red character with multiple armsand surgical tools, he seems
to know a lot about Givanium.And we get a lot of notes telling
us that he's worked with the stuff,but he's also keeping his
cards close to his chest,telling us that he can't say anything
because that information is classified.And I'd understand why.Givanium is apparently an element,
a genome, artificial blood.And oh, yeah, it explodes.I wouldn't be surprised if the
reason he's so tight lipped,metaphorically anyway, is because
there just isn't an answer.It's a classic deus ex machina, able
to do whatever the Euphoric Brothersneed it to do in order to move the story along.Or at least that's what I initially thought,because even though Givanium seems impossible,I have found a substance or combination
of substances that exist right now,which would take this from
science fiction to science fact.And with us now having Syringian
being a man or thing of science,I think it would be great if he
weren't just spouting complete nonsensethe entire time, you know?So consider this my gift
to you, Euphoric Brothers,in honor of my first Bam Bam Theory as host.Whip out those copies of banned biology,because it's time to figure out
what Givanium is really made of.The most obvious thing I can think
of that gives us any kind of clueas to what this stuff is
supposed to be is its name.Givanium having that iom at
the end immediately reminds meof the elements from the periodic table.In fact, 79 of the 118
currently discovered elementshave a name that ends in iom,
so it would fit right in.The logo for Givanium also
seems to align with this.We see it plastered all around the facility,and it looks like it would
belong alongside the likes ofmiterium and praseodymium.These details seem to suggest that Givanium
is simply a newly discovered element,but there's one big problem with that notion.As you may be aware, elements on the
periodic table aren't placed at random.They're arranged by their atomic number,which is the number of protons
they have around their nucleus.Hydrogen has one proton, therefore
it has an atomic number of one,and is listed first in the periodic table.But take another look at the
periodic image for Givanium,and you'll see it has an
atomic number of infinity.I don't think I need to tell
you that it's not possibleto have an infinite number of protons.An element has to have a set
amount of them to be an element.Infinite is just a never-ending amount,and even if it were possible,
it would be incredibly unstable.We see this with any element
beyond element 98, californium.All of these elements have
too many protons to be stable,and so they aren't actually found in nature.They can only be created artificially in a lab,and when they do, these elements only
exist for very brief amounts of time.Oganesson, the largest element
we have with 118 protons,has a half-life of just 7 tenths of a millisecond.That's around 18 and a half times fasterthan your brain can even
process visual information.After that, it breaks down into
lighter elements which are more stable.So even if Givanium was meant
to be some super-heavy element,it is highly unlikely that it could ever
be created in large enough quantitiesor exist long enough to ever
have a barrel of the stuff.Instead, I think the name
Givanium is more of a red herring.Or more accurately, it's just dubious marketing.Brands add the "-ium"- suffix
to their products all the timeto make them sound more scientific.The same thing goes for the infinity symbol.It's supposed to make things
feel more cool and futuristic.I mean, just look at Facebook's rebrand to Meta.That's what I think we're seeing here.In one of the notes, we see that
Givanium is being shipped infrom another location, quote, down south.So this isn't something they're
making at the kindergarten,but instead, they're buying it in from a supplier.A supplier that is using clever
branding to promote their product.This actually makes figuring out the
whole thing a heck of a lot easier.Because now, the only
information we have to tackleis what we learn from the
scientific case update reportsthat we find throughout the game.Besides listing their name, case
number, and lore about the characters,each of these mascot reports
lists one very specific detail.Their genome.A genome is just another name for
a creature's entire genetic code.Basically, their whole string of DNA.Each of us gets one genome.That's what makes us unique.My genome is going to be
different from your genome.But each of us just has the one.So the fact that there were
multiple genomes listed,including Givanium,immediately got me worried that
we'd hit another roadblock.You just can't really have
two full genomes at once.But I think the Euphoric Brothers
were actually on the right track.In one of Stinger Flynn's entries,they talk about mixing Givanium
with the other genomes,which sounds to me like they're
creating one genome out of the parts,or DNA, from multiple genomes.And so that got me thinking about
a little scientific discoveryknown as the CRISPR-Cas9 complex.CRISPR is an absolute game-changerwhen it comes to the future of genetic research.Originally discovered as
part of the defence systemin certain species of bacteria,you can think of CRISPR as the world's
first genetic find-and-replace tool.Scientists who want to edit,
say, the gene of eye colour,would synthesise a small segment of DNAthat matches the gene they wish to edit.This snippet of DNA is then
attached to the CRISPR-Cas9.This complex can then be inserted
into the DNA of a person,and the CRISPR will go and cut out the DNAonly at the place in the genome
that matches the snippet.From here, scientists can add in new DNA,like the gene of a different eye colour.And voila! You've functionally
edited the genome of one personwith the DNA from a different person.And it doesn't just work
within one species either.There have been experiments
introducing human genes into pigsto make their organs more suitable for transplant.And there's a study going on right nowto see if introducing elephant genes to humanscan stop the development of cancerous tumours.Basically, with the help of CRISPR,we can essentially add any gene
we want into any genome we'd like.It's truly insane stuff,which seems fitting given how insane
the lore of this franchise is.But there's a cherry on top of all of this.CRISPR is obviously really small.So in order for scientists to better monitorwhere the DNA they've added has gone,they'll often attach a special
protein to the CRISPR mixcalled GFP, or green fluorescent protein,which, if the name wasn't a huge giveaway,is a fluorescent green colour,just like the Givanium we see throughout the game.Of course, CRISPR isn't without its side effects,and it turns out we also see those in the game.One of the things that
scientists are most worried aboutwhen it comes to CRISPR is the potentialthat this cutting process
may cut in the wrong placeand lead to serious mutations,something that we see time and time againto characters like a Pila bird, NabNab and Banbanwhen they are exposed to excess Givanium.There's also concerns that modifying one genecould affect other genes in unforeseen ways,which is probably why the
game makes it quite clearthat adding more than three
genomes together is a big no-no,leading to a phenomenon known as a genome cloy,where the mascot will
essentially reject the other DNAand revert back to a single, uncombined genome.And finally, there's a chance
that the body's immune systemwill fight and reject whatever
DNA you're trying to plug in.We see this all the time with
organ and blood transplants,but the same thing is feared with CRISPR,because it's essentially a bacteria.So not only might the body
be fighting foreign DNA,but also the bacteria that it's not used to,leading to the foreign substance
getting attacked by the bodyand causing immense amounts of pain,just like we hear about in the case reports.However, CRISPR can only be half the story.CRISPR explains Givanium's
colour, the side effects,and its ability to combine
with genes from other donors,but CRISPR doesn't have DNA of its own.For Givanium to be considered
a genome, as the game puts it,it would need its own set
of DNA to splice itself inwith whatever human or jellyfish DNAthe scientists would choose.So we need to figure out what creaturethe Givanium DNA is actually coming from.The problem is, there are literally
millions of possible species on this planet,so narrowing it down to just oneseems like it would be like
trying to find a crayonin the world's largest kindergarten.Fortunately, the game does give
us a couple of clues to work with.In the case report for case
one, update number two,we get this line about the functions of Givanium.The case mentioned in the
previous report has moved an arm,as if its artificial nervous system
had worked for a split second.As predicted, GV seems to provide
identical functions to blood.It also had a strange physical effect.GV appears to expand in
size when it is set to flow,and as a result, the case has grown
a number of veins across its body.So, not only is Givanium supposedly carrying
out the role of blood in these mascots,it's also able to create more
complicated body structureslike artificial veins and nervous systems.CRISPR can do many things,but act like blood or create veins
or nervous tissue, it cannot.But you know what might?Stem cells.Our bodies are made up of lots
of different kinds of cells.Brain cells, heart cells, colon cells,each one programmed to carry
out a specific role in the body.But not all cells are so specialized.When you're first conceived,your body is made up of a unique
kind of cell known as a stem cell.Stem cells are essentially cells that don't
know what they want to be when they grow up.They might become a heart cell or a
brain neuron, only time will tell.Unfortunately, by the time you're born,the vast majority of your stem
cells will have differentiatedinto all the different cell
types that make up your body.However, we aren't looking for
humans as our Givanium donors.On the case reports, Givanium is listed
as a separate genome from humans.And in the update report, it says,Now, technically, mammalian isn't a word.But I think I get where they're coming from.Basically, it cannot be a
mammal-based circulatory system.And so Givanium is not only
non-human, but also non-mammal.So what does that leave us with?We need a specimen that is not a mammalwith the ability to create stem
cells throughout its life cyclethat could be turned into
whatever body part is necessary.Should be simple, right?Well, as it turns out, there's a lot
of wacky creatures in this world,and some of them have the ability
to grow any body part they wantwhen it's been damaged or even cut off.Many species of lizards can regrow their tails.Axolotls have been known to
regrow their heart muscles,spinal cords, and whole other limbs.But there is one creature that
knocks all of them out of the water,a goofy-looking flatworm known as the planarian.When it comes to regenerational
prowess, no one beats the planarian.This thing is generating stem cells indefinitely,able to create skin, vein-like structures, nerves,to the point that if you cut a planarian in half,not only does the head regrow its missing tail,but the newly-severed tail
will grow an entirely new head.No wonder all these characters in Garden of Banbanseem to just spring back to life
after being severely injured.They just need a breather to regrow
and repair all the damaged bits.Not only that, but studies have
shown that this newly-grown head,for some reason,is able to retain and pass on
memories from its previous head.If the memory gene from the
planaria is being splicedinto the human genomes put into these mascots,it could explain why, for some reason,these mascots have memories about the
lives of their human genome donors,such as their name and occupation.Planaria don't have traditional
circulatory systems either.Instead, they have what appear to be veins,but it's really their digestive system,and it does pretty much the same thing
a circulatory system does for mammals.It transports nutrients throughout the body.So, that's a big old tip for the
non-mammal circulatory system thing.And speaking of nutrients,what is the one thing we know
that Banban loves to eat?No liver, no intestines,but most importantly, no pancreas.And you'll never guess what planarians feed on.Dead and decaying materials
such as organs, including liver,and, yes, pancreas.Despite the fact that, according to some studies,it has proven to offer very
little nutritional value to them.Maybe Banban should just stick to the vegetables.Grab some of the vegetables.
Thanks for your collection indeed.But we can't just say Givanium is
planarian DNA and call it a day.No, sirree.The other genomes listed on the case reportuse the full scientific names of specific species.So, what planarian is gyvanian from exactly?Thankfully, there's one detail that
helps narrow it down, the location.There's a note that tells us
that Givanium comes from, quote,our friends down south.And based on the plane ticket telling us
the closest airport is Montreal, Canada,it feels pretty conclusive
that our friends down southare somewhere in the United States.And while planaria aren't
native to the United States,there are a handful of species that have
managed to migrate their way to its shores.And one of them doesn't just do
everything we've already talked about,but it also looks suspiciously like our
new friend slash betrayer, syringian.Let me introduce you all to
the shovel-headed garden worm,or as it's technically called, bipaleum coents.Yeah, syringian's head isn't an accident.According to syringian's case reports,
he's made up of only two genomes,human and Givanium.But much like how Stinger Flynn's
form is based on his jellyfish DNA,syringian seems to be based more
on his Givanium or bipaleum siderather than his human one.And with this being the
specific species for Givanium,bipaleum coents is known
for secreting a neurotoxinthat can be dangerous to humans and pets.That toxin isn't mixing well with
the mascot's human and animal parts.But with that, it feels like we found
ourselves the source of Givanium,planarians, specifically bipaleum coents,a non-mammalian creature from the United Stateswith extraordinary regenerative abilities,able to rebuild their vein-like
digestive system and nervous system.Then just mix it in with CRISPR-Cas9
and a little green protein,and you too can create these unholy abominationsin your own haunted kindergarten.There's just one tiny detail that I mentionedright at the start of this
video that I've yet to address.I had this entire theory
written out and ready to gobefore Banban7 dropped, and so, of course,they had to throw one final curveball at me.Givanium explodes.Why?Why would you do this to me?We were this close to a clean run!It's OK. It's fine.We can do this. Deep breaths.The reason this is initially such a problemis that DNA isn't explosive or flammable.In fact, it's quite the opposite.Researchers have found that DNA is
a great flame-retardant substanceand are experimenting with
coating highly flammable materialslike cotton with it.However, what if it's not the DNA exploding,but the barrel the Givanium is stored in?Take a look at the explosion.It's not a fiery explosion like the
others we've seen in the games before.There's an immediate flash with some sparks,and then there's just a pillar of white smoke.That looks less like the burning of
a flammable substance like plane fueland instead more like when
a pressure cooker explodes.Why would that be the case here?Well, as we've discussed, Givanium contains DNAand it is common practice to
store DNA in liquid nitrogenso that it doesn't degrade.Now, liquid nitrogen has a temperature
of minus 196 degrees Celsiusor minus 320 degrees Fahrenheit,which is a problem because
most places aren't that cold.And so it heats up, turning
from a liquid into a gas.This wouldn't be an issue so long
as it's stored in a containerwith a loose-fitting lid and not,
oh, I don't know, an oil drum.Those things are known for having tight sealsand they've been left out at
least since Bring a Friend Day,if not well before that.And so the nitrogen gas continues
building and building and buildinguntil we hit the final nail in the
coffin by lighting the drum on fire.How we do that, I'm not exactly sure.It's not like there's a fuse or anything.But regardless, that extra heat
clearly tips it over the edge,heating up the gas to the point
where it can no longer be contained.And then boom, an explosion of gas
with the metal barrel breaking apartand scraping against itself,
causing sparks to fly.Given how all these containers
have been left out for a while,maybe we'd be best to avoid them going forward.But there you have it, theorists,the scientific answer for what
Banban's mysterious Givanium truly is.Bipalium-coensed DNA combined with
CRISPR and green fluorescent proteins,all stored in giant vats of liquid
nitrogen to keep them stable.Is this going to be the answer we're
given in the final Bam Bam game?Well, Banban 304?Eh, probably not.But I'm hoping that the
Euphoric Brothers see this videoand maybe, just maybe, we can steer
at least part of this franchisein a more realistic direction.Wouldn't that be something?And hey, if you guys want a science consultant,I'd be happy to help out.I'm just a DM away.Who am I kidding?You guys are just going to say
it's alien blood, aren't you?But hey, that's just a theory.A game theory!Thanks for watching.And if finding out the scientific plausibility
of bluish-green liquids is your thing,then why don't you slurp the video on screento watch me figure out what is
in Fortnite's famous slurp juice?Happy watching, theorists.kindergarten 3 is going to be a bloodymess the game has been announced and ourold pal the janitor is back though he'snot looking great and yet he's walkingaround as if nothing's happened after atraumatic injury you know like losing ahand time is of the essence in just 60seconds you'll have lost 50% of yourblood your heart will stop pumping andyour organs will shut down as you slipinto a coma after 2 minutes you'll havelost all your blood and you'll be deadin 2 and a half the janitor wouldpractically be a goner by the time wefinish the trailer now it does appearthat the janitor has done something totry and stop the bleeding it's lessgushing and more spurting but even if heapplied a makeshift tourit he wouldstill need medical attention within acouple of hours he's still at risk ofbleeding out just slower even outside ofthat his chances aren't great astourniquets can cause muscle and nervedamage if used for too long and he has ahigh chance of getting that open woundinfected I mean have you seen thiskindergarten just don't ask him if heneeds a hand he gets a bit sensitiveyikesHello, Internet! Welcome to Game Theory, the show that's not afraid to admit when it's all washed up.On a video game island full of lore, that is.Because I'm finally getting around to talking about the ARG that blew every other ARG I worked on out of the water.We would have probably talked about this sooner, but it came out on January 1st, and we were... a little busy here at Theorist.So, after five months, I figured it was high time we take a look at the difficult and disturbing game that took the Internet by storm.Shipwrecked 64.Now, if this is your first time seeing this game, you might think it's going to be similar to other lost video games we've covered in the past, like Petscop,where we watch found footage of someone else playing the game and see the ARG story unfold before us.But not this time, friends, because this is a game you can actually play for yourselves.That's right, this game puts you in the driver's seat and gives you the opportunity to go around and find the secrets yourself.And there are a bunch to find.But to get them, you have to solve some of the toughest puzzles I've ever encountered.And sometimes, you even have to fight the most basic of gamer instincts.You have to lose.If you do, though, you are rewarded with the thing that we all crave.Lore.Lore about a company falling on hard times, one man's desperate attempts to save his wife, and one of the most brutal mascot killers the Internet has ever seen.This is truly one of the most disturbing and outright horrifying game experiences the Internet has to offer.But it's also the most fun I've had solving an ARG in a long time.So let's set sail together, loyal theorists, as we go through the puzzles, solutions, and story of Shipwrecked 64.Booting up the game, we're immediately given a choice.Well, kinda.We can see that there are two versions of this game.One from 2023, which is a recreated version of the original Shipwrecked game for the Nintendo 64.And there's a locked version that appears to be that original game, the one that was removed from store shelves.However, to unlock that version, we need to complete the 2023 version.So off we go.We take on the role of Bucky Beaver and start the game Shipwrecked on an island.No surprise there.We are then tasked with finding our crew and rebuilding our boat.The bad news is, you only have five days to do it, as a volcano is due to erupt and destroy the whole island.So best get cracking.By exploring the island, you'll find your crew one by one, and they'll ask you to complete a minigame to free them from the island's inhabitants and rejoin your crew.Walter Walrus needs you to platform your way to switches to free your second boat.Just don't move when the lights go out.Olive Otter asks you to collect 30 coconuts within the time limit, and Giovanni Goose needs you to stop the ovens from catching fire.You can also find the chief of the island, Chief Wolf, who gives you a minigame to rebuild your boat.Each time you play a minigame, time passes, so be quick about it.You can end the game in one of four ways.You can escape the island with or without your crew, or you can choose to stay and either wait for the clock to run out, killing everyone, or explore the volcano, finding a barge that will not only save your crew, but all the inhabitants of the island.However, the ending you choose doesn't really matter, because by getting any ending, you unlock the thing we're really after, the 1997 version of Shipwreck 64.When you start a new game and select this version, we are given a warning that it is not for the faint of heart, and that it's unaltered from its initial release.If that's not an invitation, I don't know what is.This is where the true nature of this game starts to appear, because while on the surface it seems to be the same game, something is off about it.There are suddenly locked doors with what appears to be gibberish written on the signs next to them, but we're theorists.Nothing in these games is just gibberish.This is a substitution cipher, but it's not like one that we've used in the past.Essentially, it involves swapping letters back and forth to create a new phrase.A equals B, B equals A, C equals D, D equals C, and so on.Deciphering the three signs gives you the codes Layer 2, Room 1, Layer 2, Room 2, and Layer 2, Room 3.This doesn't mean a whole lot for us.But if you stand around for too long trying to figure it out, you'll see there's more wrong with this version of the game than a few misspelt signs.From here, you can go through and play the rest of the game as normal, win the minigames, and get off the island.But where's the fun in that?There are clearly secrets to find, so what do we need to do?Well, it starts by losing.That's right, if you lose each of the minigames, things begin to fall apart.Each time you fail, the minigame gets harder and harder to beat.And with each time that happens, we're treated to some disturbing clips that begin to hint at what this game's lore is.Walter's minigame shows us a clip of someone wearing a costume of Bucky looking down at something with a bunch of squelching noises in the background.We may not be able to see what's happening, but our minds can pretty much fill in the gaps, especially with an indie horror game.But this isn't the only secret Walter's game is hiding.Near the final switch, you're meant to go through this door and then out the other side.But if you instead jump over to the other side and then try to re-enter the door from the wrong side,you suddenly find yourself in a long corridor with a button at the end that plays a clip from a man named Mark Mullins.He's taking someone to hospital, which is useful to bear in mind, but the most notable thing right now is that he mentioned no one has been acting right lately.Could this be referring to the Bucky we just saw?Maybe Mark noticed Bucky's weird behavior before whatever happened in that squelchy video.It's hard to say, but Bucky does certainly continue to get more and more unhinged as time goes on.When you get to Olivia's section, it's split into two parts.In the penultimate failed attempt, we can hear an audio recording from a woman titled Olivia's Last Phone Call.Olivia complains about him showing up again, only for Bucky to once again appear, banging to be heard and the audio going quiet.Normally, this is where I'd start theorizing about exactly what's happening here, but Olive's second section does that for us.You're back in the same room, but if you parkour off the walls, you'll find Olive face down in the water, a trail of blood behind her, and another Bucky staring down at her.Bucky, this evil Bucky, killed this woman, Olivia, represented by Olive, and dragged her body to the lake.Now, I thought that was pretty dark, but nothing could have prepared me for failing Giovanni Goose's game, because after a couple of failed attempts, Giovanni stops being interactable.You can try, but nothing happens.And then...Sorry, we had to blur a lot of that for YouTube.So, if you were wondering, that is a man having his head bashed against a microwave and dunked in a deep fat fryer by Bucky.It is brutal.Really, not what I or anyone expected when playing this game for the first time.Oh my god! Oh! Oh, jeez!So, what on earth is going on here?Well, if you break out of bounds through this glitchy wall during the Giovanni minigame, you can find a single oven engulfed in flames, with Giovanni Goose laying on top of it.It seems to be a recreation of the gruesome scene we just witnessed, with Giovanni Goose taking the place of the human whose head was shoved in the deep fryer.With these characters being mascot costumes, it's possible that the guy we're seeing is actually Giovanni's human performer, and he was brutally murdered by whoever was playing Bucky.This would also confirm that the dead version of Olive we see floating in the river was another recreated scene.And while we don't know what happened to Walter's performer, Bucky standing over him with squelching noises playing?Yeah, it doesn't give me the best confidence he's okay.That brutal clip we just saw also gives us a date.1990.But this game came out in 1997, meaning the company would have had to have covered all of this up for seven years.Is that why these videos are present in the game?To expose the company that the Steam page tells us is known as Broadside Studios?But if that's the case, who's trying to expose them, and why?For that, we need to go to this weird glitch you can find in the living quarters area after you fail the minigames.Walk into the glitching wall texture, and you'll find yourself face-to-face with Chief Wolf once again.Only, it's not Chief Wolf.The name that pops up on screen is Connor.At first, I wondered if Connor was another victim of Bucky's, the actor for Chief Wolf.But then I read their dialogue, and it is... strange.They talk about polygons working together to create an illusion, and go on to say that they made all of this.Is Connor the game's developer?It's the only thing that would make sense with this kind of dialogue.And there's been plenty of indie horror games with devs trapped in their own games before.Except, unlike most of those other game devs, Connor doesn't seem to be interested in escaping.They're just admiring their work.Like, they're proud of it.Gruesome videos and all.Considering how hard this character is to find, I have a feeling this is more like a self-insert NPC.A sign to the player early on from the dev that they're heading in the right direction.Okay, so, we have an idea of who did this, but we still don't know why he felt the need to turn against Broadside.So, let's keep digging.Remember those locked doors I pointed out earlier?The ones with the sign saying, Layer 2, Room 1?Well, once you completely fail each minigame, those locked doors become unlocked,and allow you to travel to a deeper, second layer of the game.Which, I guess, explains the Layer 2 thing.Now, I'm not gonna run through how to do every little puzzle in each of these next rooms.Or for the entirety of this game, for that matter.There are so many puzzles that this would be an hour-long video if I were to explain each one step-by-step.Not every puzzle has lore significance either.And finally, I actually think it's just fun to leave some mystery for you guys so that you can go and play this for yourselves.I promise you, it's well worth it.But, what I do want to do is to explain the primary puzzles that you need to solve to progress.Because I have never seen ciphers like this used before.And this won't be the last time they get used either.So, if you go into Walter's door, you'll eventually come across a room with a number of cabins and an audio player on the wall.It's labelled with, Code is R-X-B-C.And playing it gives you a string of words.These words are part of the phonetic alphabet.Romeo, X-Ray, Bravo, and Charlie.And look at that.Those words line up with the four letters of the code label.But every keypad in the game is a four-number code, not letters.So, how does that work?Well, you have to take the number of times each word is said to get the number for each letter.In this case, Romeo is said six times, X-Ray twice, Bravo twice, and Charlie four times.Six, two, two, four.That will unlock the next part of your path.The second kind of puzzle is found through Olive's door.In one of the rooms is a recorder playing the song Hot Cross Buns.And on the wall, it says, Code is E-C-D-C.If you explore a little, you'll find another recorder that talks about downloading sheet music.And that is exactly what you have to do here.Look at the sheet music for Hot Cross Buns, count the number of times the notes E, C, and D are used,and bam, that's your code.I told you these ciphers were clever.But it's Giovanni's door that is the most interesting.Inside is a small theater, which, if you stop and look at the screen, you'll see our four mascot friends.Except they look nightmarish.I initially wondered if these were monster versions, and that maybe this was the Bucky that killed the other three.But we saw from earlier that the Bucky looked pretty normal when he attacked.So, I'm not entirely sure what to make of this right now.Nevertheless, we must carry on to the next room, a red dining hall.And after some puzzles, an art gallery.In the gallery, there is a keypad on the wall that once again requires a four-number code to unlock.Next to it, you can see banners of four colors in order.Red, blue, blue, green.And if you paid attention to the room, you'll notice all the paintings are colored.Some of them have numbers on them.Red is eight, blue is three, and green is nine.Those numbers remain the same throughout the game, so do take note.But once you get through the hallway, you'll start to hear something.I like that they're just giving us the lore though.That is exactly what they're doing, Matt.This audio gives you all the backstory on broadside animation that we could possibly need to know.We learn of a man named Rex, an artist that struggled to find success.But eventually, in the 1940s, his first character, a rabbit, suddenly took off.Only for him to lose the rights to that character, eventually leading to the creation of Bucky Beaver.If this sounds familiar, it should.It's exactly the same thing as what happened to Walt Disney in Oswald the Lucky Rabbit,and the rise of arguably the most famous cartoon character of all time, Mickey Mouse.And just like good old Disney, after a lot of success with this new cast of characters,eventually they would open up a theme park called Studio Grounds.However, this recording offhandedly mentions a previous park that Studio Grounds is based on.One located on an island that you could only travel to by boat.To get to this point in the game, we've traveled through kitchens, dining rooms, beach huts,pools, theaters, all things that would make sense at an island theme park.It's not just the murders that are being recreated inside this game.This whole place is a recreation of that original theme park, Broadside Beach.Beyond the corridor is a museum and a switch.Hit it, and we end up in a new hub room.Solve the puzzles, and we find a computer with a switch that opens up a browser tab,showing us a website for a company called Cogware Games.This About Us page tells us about the employees, Elizabeth, Harry, and Connor.Looks like we were right about Connor being the dev of this game.These guys talk about their desire to pursue 3D graphics,as well as adult humor and, quote, some edge.Yeah, I think you might have overshot that one, guys.Moving forward, though, the tone suddenly shifts.On the walls are drawings of a game of Hangman, with most of the name Brandon filling in the spaces.Text warning us to stop, and a drawing of Bucky with his third eye open.Something tells me going down here is going to start connecting a lot of dots for us.We're going to see things as they really are.And so, in search of that sweet, sweet lore, we continue to venture down into Layer 3.Here, the world is dark.We're given a single candle and a tape recorder.On it, someone is describing the death we saw played out with the character Olive back on Layer 1.Someone in a Bucky costume dragging a woman to the water and drowning her in the lake,confirming that what we've been seeing in the game are recreations of real-life events.We have to continue on until we reach a computer, and it has a lot to say.The horrors that are to come, the concept of the layers we find ourselves in, and the ciphers we have been solving.The Substitution Cipher is a language known as Beaver Scratch.The Alphabet Puzzle is called a Shakespeare Cipher.The Music Puzzle is a Mozart Cipher, and the Picture Puzzle is a Picasso Cipher.While this information is certainly useful, I feel like it would have been more useful, you know,a layer ago, when I was banging my head against the wall trying to figure out how they worked.But, no matter.We're here now, and we must go forth, exploring the three doors available, in order to move on.Technically, you can actually only explore two doors, but there are important audio recordings in each one,so, of course, I've checked them all out.Two of them come from Connor, who describes how progress for the game is going,describing areas and characters from Shipwreck 64, and how they're going to be presented to someone called Mark later.Oh, oh, Mark!The guy from that audio tape we heard earlier, the one with the terminally ill partner.If Cogware Games is working on a Broadside game, and they're going to be presenting to Mark later,that would mean that Mark is likely a higher-up at Broadside.But, based on this third recording we get from Connor, it seems like he's not the easiest guy to work with.Once again, Connor is leaving a breadcrumb trail to reveal to us the truth about what happened,and the company behind it all.It seems like Connor found the footage of these deaths, the ones that we've been witnessing.I mean, I wouldn't feel safe around a guy that lets monsters like this run loose, would you?Yet, he also seems to still be willing to work with Mark.He's not acting like he wants to expose the truth he's found, so, what changed for him to do so later?Oh, and speaking of monster, this particular room offers us insight into one of the characters we've not been able to identify, Bucky himself.So far, we've found the victims, the devs of the game, and Mark, but the serial killer Bucky has remained a mystery.However, after looking at this wall, I believe we finally have a name.On the wall, we see the words, Who Are You?, along with a drawing that will look familiar to those of you who cleared the puzzles in Walter's Waterway.It's a statue of Bucky.There's also seven letters missing, just like the ones we saw earlier in the hallway that spell out the name, Brandon.Brandon is the name of the guy inside the costume, the one that was acting strange and lashed out to his co-stars.This is where the gameplay gets a lot harder, because now, we're being attacked by monster versions of the four major mascots that we saw in the glitchy footage.Turns out, these are known as Dwellers, and they are horrifying.But regardless of this new threat, we are still on the hunt for lore, and it is everywhere on this floor.If you look at the walls very carefully while you're solving puzzles, you'll find notes from Cogware Games, and these blow a massive part of the Broadside backstory wide open.There are dozens of these notes around the level, but after just a couple, you start to get the picture.I was at the offices last night.I had brought a drive with me.It contained our presentation for Broadside.I didn't grab the drive on the way out.When I slid my drive into the slot, nothing I included was there, but instead, a branching web of folders, the contents of which were repulsive.Many different folders.So many names.So many labels.So many mistakes.It's sickening.Folders dedicated to old cartoons, but not just that.Cover-ups, too.A little girl was crushed in the squirrel cruise.Quite literally, head caught between the track and the boat.I saw the pictures.It's as bad as you think.Oh, and it gets worse.So much worse.Not only have guests died, but employees have, too.Before Studio Grounds, they owned an entire island, and on that island, at the very least, there were three deaths.Connor definitely saw the horrifying footage that we've seen.The three employee deaths that happened on an island resort owned by Broadside that Cogware Games decided to recreate.Murders and all.But if you keep going and complete the various Picasso and Mozart ciphers, as well as a few code-based puzzles that are lying around,and then you collect the batteries for the in-game computer, we are actually treated to a zip folder full of at least some of the files that the notes mention.We have three folders named Olivia, Nathan, and Gary.Olivia's folder contains Olive's character model, pictures of her as a human and in costume, and the audio recordings we've heard,as well as this note that once again confirms that what we've witnessed in the game is 100% a recreation of what happened that night.By checking Gary's folder, we can also find the footage that we've already seen, as well as the aftermath of his corpse from being dunked in the deep fryer.Gary was Giovanni's actor, which leaves Nathan as Walter's actor, and in his folder, we finally see what was missing from the mysterious squelchy clip we heard earlier.Bucky walked over to him and beat him to death with a chair.Yeah, it was never gonna be good, was it?And yet, the question remains, why give this to us?Why expose Broadside like this?I mean, sure, the company is clearly not a good company, but is that enough motivation?Connor found these files, but still seemed to be willing to work with Mark on this game.This is also an official game, after all.Broadside were paying for this, so why risk it?Well, before you finish the plaza, there is one audio recording that shines some light on this, and it's from our friend Mark.Our entire brand's been going down the drain.The best option we got is to cut the game studio we've hired.I'm gonna schedule a meeting with them, and if they don't have exactly, exactly what they promised, we cut them off.I'm throwing the exact same amount of money I'm paying for Harley's medical bills into this game studio!Broadside was bleeding money, which is unsurprising when you're busy, you know, covering up murders, running TV shows, theme parks, and your own freaking private island.Plus, this person, Harley, seems to be the loved one that Mark mentioned earlier in the audio log.The one that's going to be in hospital for a long time.He's also having to pay for those medical bills.And so, the best plan of action is for him to cut all funding to the video game, or so he thinks.For a small indie studio, losing a deal like this could cause them to completely go under.If that happens, they'd likely want revenge.Especially if they happen to stumble across a bunch of files that reveal to them the cover-ups and murders that the company had committed.And once we leave Layer 3, that is exactly what we see play out.Layer 4, to start with, is essentially a tech demo.But, use the elevator to descend into the sewers, and you'll once again face a gamer's worst nightmare.Not scary monsters, no, we love that stuff!Instead, you once again have to lose by getting caught by the Dwellers.Landing yourself in a jail cell, but also giving yourself access to a new area with some Picasso ciphers and two new audio logs from Connor.One titled Dev Log Panic, and the other Resolution.Toss the script. Toss the f***ing script! It's done! It's over!I can't even lie to myself on this recording, it went horribly!All that work, all for nothing!It's only a matter of time till I get their two-week notices on my desk.Change of plans. Liz has already done everything she needed to.Harry's done, well, enough. I'm taking the reins now.I'm completing this on my own. No help, no influence from Broadside, Mark, or any of those disgusting f***s.I was worried about what he'd do to me!By the time I'm done with him, he'll regret the day he first uttered my name!Connor was blindsided by Mark's decision.He was ready to go in with a full presentation, only to be completely shot down and cut off from the project.Now, he's mad. Mad enough that he's going to make Mark regret everything.By outing Broadside's awful practices.By recreating the parks, as well as all the murders that took place.And by leaving a trail of breadcrumbs that we've been piecing together of how Broadside and Mark treated Cogware Games.Anyone that got their hands on this game would be able to figure out what happened.And it would likely mean the end of Mark and Broadside.That could have been where the story ended.A scorned developer taking revenge on a man that ruined his career.However, the game keeps going.There's a demo for a game that you have to download and play to unlock more codes.Which, can I just say, is insane for an ARG video game.It's one thing to link to webpages and YouTube videos like we've been doing throughout this game.But to create, essentially, a second game just to hide a few codes?I tip my hat to you, sir. Truly inspired.But, thanks to that demo, we now have access to the final layer.Layer 5.At this point, we are introduced to a new character.A character that the game describes as made of wood and cloth.Except, it can move. And even speak.I thought I was the only one rotting down here.So much has happened. So much.It's all beyond your understanding.I need you to find me.If you do as I ask, you'll know everything.Every single detail of what happened.You are speaking my language, weird statue-looking thing.And so our last task is to find this thing 10 times on the original island map.And if we do, we finally get to the end of this game.We're met with a final audio log that shows the meeting between Connor and Mark.Where Mark shut down the whole thing.Leading Connor to create that earlier audio log and take over the project.To reveal the truth about Broadside.But, sadly, his revenge didn't seem to fix anything.We end up in a final tunnel that leads to a balcony.The only option is for us to jump off it.And by doing so, we cut to real footage of a real balcony.As well as a statement from Cogware Games.Connor took his own life.We get some slides reminding us that when these details inside the game were found,the game was pulled from store shelves.Connor's efforts were once again going to be covered up by Broadside.Likely pinned on him as a rogue indie game developer trying to slander their good name.Just like we've seen time and time again in other indie franchises.The majority of them were total fabrications from the mind of a complete lunatic.Lawsuit's pending.And with that, knowing he couldn't do anything to stop them,and with his own reputation destroyed,Connor jumped off the balcony.Leaving behind nothing but a broken family, a broken game, and his own personal calling card.An NPC wolf, hidden inside the glitches of the game that someone might one day find.And that, my friends, is the sad but incredible story of Shipwreck 64.The story of a studio-turned-theme-park attraction that was responsible for the deaths of dozens of people.Only for them to cover up the entire thing to keep their success going.It's a story of a CEO who appeared to be ruled by greed.Cutting corners, staging cover-ups, and firing a game studio that was genuinely just trying to make a good product.But, it turns out, it wasn't greed. It was love.Mark was desperate to save his partner.They needed life-saving care.But, as is often the case, the cost was just too much.So, he did the only thing he could.Cut off the game studio funding.Only for them to reveal to the world all the tragedies his company had caused and tried to hide.He tried to stop it, but after all these years, the truth has finally been revealed.In the end, both sides ended up losing.What an incredibly powerful story, and an incredible gaming experience.However, while I feel really good about the artists we've come to today,I can't help but feel there's more that I'm missing.I know that there's a bunch of posters and audio recordings we didn't get to mention simply due to time,but even still, despite the length of this video and the hours I've spent playing the game,I actually think I've only scratched the surface.We still don't understand why Bucky's actor went on a murder spree.If this game is designed to be a recreation of the real island, then what are the dwellers about?We saw enough pictures of these nightmarish characters, so where do they fit into all of this?And what's the truth behind that weird wooden entity we chased around the island at the end?I know the answers to those questions do exist.However, it's gonna have to wait until next time, because to fully understand them,we're going to have to venture beyond just the game, and into the deep lore that hides in documentaries,demos, and ARGs that are all present on the developer's YouTube channel.So, if you are interested in getting those answers, let me know down in the comments.And, of course, make sure you're subscribed so that when the video does drop, you don't miss it.In the meantime, friends, remember, that's just a theory.A GAME THEORY!Thanks for watching.And

scenarios right now.We should do a Game Theory.Maybe Tom, maybe I'll hit up Tom.I'll be like, hey, Tom, can we do an episodeabout the physics of this magical loincloth?Guess we're doing this.Hello, Internet.Welcome to Game Theory, the show that's holding onto its last bit of sanity for dear life.But as hard as I try, after only eight episodes,I've let go and I'm falling straight into the deep ends.Instead of covering a major game releaseor having a meta discussion about the gaming industry,I'm doing an episode on the latest rage gameto hit the internet, A Difficult Game About Climbing.If you haven't seen this game yet,well, it's right there in the title.It's a difficult game about climbing.It was created by Pontypants as a spiritual successorto Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy,the OG difficult climbing game.Oh, oh, no, oh, no, no, no, oh God, no, no, no, no!No, no!The only difference is that instead of climbingusing a silly hammer, our character is climbingup this mountain with his bare hands.You'd think that would make this easier to control,but you would be wrong.So the fact that he's sacrificingtwo critical points of contact is, ah, ah, no, no, no, no!Can I please climb on top of the rock and sit for a second?I, I, I, no, no, no!No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!Wait, what happened?How did?But while everyone else is posting videosof their speedruns and raid compilations,here I am doing a video no one asked for.No one except for my boss, that is.Well, if it's an episode about loincloth physics he wants,it's an episode about loincloth physics he will get.Although he might be getting more than he bargained forbecause by trying to answer this seemingly simple questionabout a piece of fabric, I was let down a rabbit holethat completely unraveled this game's universe.By the end of it, I felt like I had climbed a mountainwith my bare hands.Turns out, there is more to this man than meets the eye,and I'm not talking about what he's hiding under that cloth.I mean, the science of this game is weird,and it causes all kinds of domino effectsthat I did not expect to be thinking aboutwhen playing a Foddian game.There are so many questions that I didn't need answers forthat I now have answers for.So, in typical theorist fashion,I'm now going to share them all with you.Without further ado, I present to youa difficult theory about a difficult game about climbing.Before we discuss any physicsabout our climber's modesty garment,we first need to discuss the physics of the climber himself.And man, this guy is a beast.He's not only able to climb up the entire mountainand city and clouds without even breaking a sweat,but he's doing it without a harnessand without using his feet,or as rock climbers call it, free soloing or campusing.Sorry about the whispering.There's a certain member of Team Theoristwho is an avid rock climber,and I'm worried that if he hears me,he's going to try and interrupt me again.Regardless, our climber is able to do all of thiswithout even having to take a break.That takes some serious grip strength and endurance.Either this man is the strongest man to have ever lived,or there's something else going on.And I think you guys can figure outwhich one I'm leaning towards.See, the thing that got my attentionwasn't just how good our player was holding onto the mountainbut instead what happens when he inevitablyfalls all the way down.Can I please climb on top of the rockand sit for a second?I, I, I...No!That buoyancy, did you see that?I did see that.My guy shoots up out of the waterlike he's some sort of boy, but why?Well, if you remember anythingfrom your fourth grade science class,you know that the physics of buoyancyall come down to density.Density is a measure of how much massan object has per unit of volume.And if you know the density of an object,you can easily figure out whether it will floator sink in a particular fluid.If an object is more dense than the fluid,it sinks.If it's less dense than the fluid, it floats.Pretty easy stuff,all of which we've covered in a couple of theories.But today, we're gonna be taking things one step furtherbecause not only can you use densityto figure out if an object will float,but you can also use it to tell how much of it will float.If an object is half as dense as the fluidit's floating in,then half of the object's volumewill end up submerged underwater.The more you increase the density,the higher the proportion of that objectwill be underwater.So to put that into math terms,when it comes to an object floating in fluid,the ratio of the densities of the object to the fluidis equal to the ratio of the volume of the objectthat is submerged to its full volume.I sound like such a nerd.Typically, humans have a densityof 985 kilograms per cubic meter.And water has a density of 997 kilograms per cubic meter,making humans less dense than water.And so we float.But my guy here is suspiciously buoyant.It's almost as if our climber is way less densethan a person typically should be.He shoots up out of the waterlike a bath toy you've submerged during bath time as a kid.No, just me.Anyway, weird childhood aside,we should be able to figure outwhy this is happening by using that formula.All we need to know is what percentage of our object,or in this case, our climber,is submerged when he's chilling at the bottom of the mountainafter falling for the 11th time.But to do that, I needed to know exactly how tall he is.Can you see why this episode broke me?Okay, so how tall is the playerin a difficult game about climbing?At first glance, he seems like a fairly tall guy,but that's not very scientific now, is it?No, for this, I needed to do something special.For the first time as host of the channel,I needed to pull out the pixel measurements.Scattered around your trek up the mountainare plenty of objectsthat could serve as potential measuring sticks.Sadly though, most of them either have no standard sizings,or if they do, they come in a variety of standard sizings.Things like the steel drum and street signscan be one of several sizes,and don't even get me startedon the variety of clothing sizes.Probably a style theory in there somewhere.Anyway, all of those would massively throw offour calculations if we picked the wrong size.So I kept looking and kept lookinguntil I found one thing that comes in one sizeand one size only, a concrete road barrier.Specifically, this type of concrete barrieris known as an F-shaped barrier,which feels like false advertising.It doesn't look anything like an F.But regardless, thanks to the American Associationof State Highway and Transportation Officials,we know exactly how tall these barriers are.Everyone, pull out your copyof the AASHTO Roadside Design Guide,that I know you all have lying around somewhere,and turn to page 164.You'll see that your F-shaped concrete barrierhas a standard height of 32 inches.So by comparing that to the size of our climber,our pixel measurements showthat he is almost exactly six foot, five inches,or nearly two meters tall.For clarity, that's the same height as Bo Burnham,which is certainly tall, but at least it's realistic.I was worried we were gonna have anotherWario is 10 foot situation on our hands.But now that we have how tall our character is,we can scale our character modelto that height in Blender.And using the volume measuring tool,we can conclude that his total volumeis 0.1057 cubic meters.Okay, we're nearly there.We just need to compare the footage from in-gameto see where to slice the 3D model.And by doing so, we can see that around 33% of his volume,or 0.035 cubic meters, is submerged underwater.Finally, we plug all that informationinto our formula from earlier,set the density of the waterto be 997 kilograms per cubic meter,and we find that the density of our climber is,drum roll please,drum roll,330.13 kilograms per cubic meter.No wonder he's so buoyant.For context, that's about as dense as bamboo,which has been used to make rafts all over the worldfor hundreds of thousands of years, thanks to its buoyancy.No need for expensive plane faresif this guy's your buddy.Just attach a motor to his feet and jet across the ocean.It's not just his densitythat's on the lighter side either.With his volume and the formula for densityequaling mass over volume,that means that he only has a mass of 41.3 kilograms,or 91 pounds,when a typical person of his sizewould be expected to weigh 104 kilograms, or 222 pounds.That actually explains why our climberis able to swing and stop himself so easily.Newton's first law of motion statesthat an object at rest stays at rest,and an object in motion stays in motionwith the same speed and in the same direction,unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.The thing that decides how much unbalanced forceis required to change the position of an objectis known as the object's inertia,and that is heavily affected by an object's mass.If something has a high mass, it has a high inertia,and therefore it makes it really hardto get that object to start moving,and hard to get it to stop, too.In the case of our climber, though,his low mass means he has a lower inertia,and so he would be able to stop his swing almost instantly,which is exactly what we see in the game.Maybe the physics of this world do make sense after all.Ha! Yeah, right.You guys know I couldn't stop there.Despite the fact we just calculatedthat our climber is lighter than we would have expected,something about it still doesn't make sense.Whenever you fall in this game, you fall like a rock,way faster than it feels like a person should.But if it's not his own mass that's causing that,then that would mean something is off with the gravity.On Earth, you may know that the accelerationdue to gravity is 9.8 meters per second squared.That is the acceleration that all objects on Earth feel.If you drop two objects at the same time,no matter how massive they are,they will always fall at an accelerationof 9.8 meters per second squared.Galileo figured out this principle back in the late 1500swith two different weighted spheres,and when the Apollo 15 astronauts went to the moon,they dropped a hammer and a featherto figure out that the objects fellat 1.625 meters per second squared.In short, as long as you have an object of any massand drop it from a known height,you can calculate exactly what the acceleration isdue to gravity on any planet,be it Earth or perhaps wherever this game takes place.This first boulder feels likea pretty good jumping off point.Don't wanna spend hours on this after all.I have way too many things to target my rage at,like the new poppy book that just dropped.But since we've already figured outthe height of our climber,we can use him as a measuring stickto figure out exactly how highthis very first boulder we climb is.Using more pixel measurements,we can measure that the distance between his feetand the surface of the water is 223.11 inches,or around 5.7 meters.Then we just let him dropand measure how long it tookfor his feet to touch the surface.After repeating the experiment five times,just to be safe,I found that the average time it took for his toesto first connect with the water was about 0.81 seconds.We plug that into our formulafor acceleration of a falling object,which is the change in distanceminus the initial velocity times time,with all of that then multiplied by twoand then divided by times squared.From there, we get an acceleration due to gravityof 19.853 meters per second squared,which is just more than two times that of Earth.Sounds impressive,but remember, his mass is lowerthan it should be for his height.So is his Dragon Ball Z gravity chamber approachto strength training actually more impressivethan a regular rock climber?Well, earlier I said a normal person on Earthat six foot five would have a mass of around 104 kilos.If we use our classic forceequals mass times acceleration formula,with the acceleration of Earth's gravitybeing 9.8 meters per second squared,then the force that person would need to pull himself upwould be 1,020 newtons of force.But if we do the same for our climberusing the mass and gravity we've already calculated,it turns out he would need a force of 692 newtonsto carry himself up.That is 32% less force than that of the real world.No wonder he's able to climb for so long without a break.He's practically floating up the cliff face.I'm sure rock climbers everywherewould kill for that kind of weight off.But while his climbing ability may not be that impressive,it's finally time to talk aboutthe most impressive thing of this game,the thing I've been teasing since the beginning.Yes, it's finally time to talk about the loincloth.Although, technically speaking,a loincloth that is held up at the waist by a beltis actually called a breechcloth.I'm just saying.And actually, actually, if you wanna be super technical,in the game files, this covering is known as a bumcloth,because there isn't actually any cloth covering the front,meaning all those bushes and bouldersare going to be brushing and scrapingall up against his personal boulders.Forget buoyancy, boy, I can't unsee that.So, what is going on with this cloth?There are three main factorsthat I could see when playing this game.Firstly, based on the way it flaps around,it's clear that this cloth is pretty thin.You're not gonna get movement like thatfrom a cloth that's thick and stiff.Secondly, when you get out of the water,the fabric doesn't seem to be wet.The water just falls right off,which means that it has to be pretty waterproof.Finally, it has to somehow stop our climberfrom having any Marilyn Monroe momentas he falls headfirst down the mountain.What material could be both thin enough to flow in the wind,yet stiff enough not to flop all over the placeand reveal the goods,and is also able to be waterproof at the same time?After hours of research onlineand manhandling every cloth at my local fabric store,I finally have an answerto this incredibly pointless question.This magical loincloth isn't actually magic at all.It's just canvas.Now, I know, when you think of canvas,you think of the thick material that artists paint on,but canvas can be made at all sorts of thicknessesdepending on the need.They can be thick enough to support painting,or they can be thin enough to make flexible bags,and yes, even cloths, all while remaining super strong.This is where our gravity conversationfrom earlier comes into play.With the gravity of this world being much stronger,any material we use would weigh almost twice as much,meaning the canvas could remain relatively thin,but it'll still act like a heavier versionof that same fabric,helping to keep the cloth falling downwardsand hiding the goods at all times.Furthermore, if we zoom into a piece of canvas,what you'll find is either cotton or linenthat has been weaved togetherin what is known as a plain woven style,a standard over-under weaving technique.Did I get that right, Amy?Please, I desperately need validation.And if we extract the texture used for the bum clothfrom the game files, what do we see?A plain weave.We even see the fraying that is typical of canvas fabric.And finally, while no natural materialis ever going to be 100% waterproof,canvas does have some waterproof properties.As any painter would tell you,you typically don't paint watercolor on canvas.Why?Because canvas isn't very absorbent.In the early 19th century,canoes used in North America were lined with canvasfor that exact reason.People have been using canvasto keep things waterproof for hundreds of years.And fun fact,you can actually make canvas even more waterproof.All you need to do is treat itwith some sort of wax or oil and boom,it'll be like water off a duck's backor water off a climber's backside, I suppose.This is why canvas was the go-to materialduring the age of sailing and pirates.Sailcloths were commonly made of canvasbecause they were strong, lightweight,and relatively waterproof.And wouldn't you know it,at the bottom of the mountain,right next to where you start the game,what do we see?But a ship with a ripped sailcloth.This ship belongs to our climber.He became shipwrecked on these rocks.His clothes were soaking wet and torn.And so he decided to fashion a loinclothout of the canvas and climb the mountain to safety.The only thing the canvas doesn't fully explainis how even despite the heavy gravity,it never falls past his buns of steel,even when he's fully upside down.Maybe there is some kind of magic in this world.That or this guy has won a heck of a shelf back therethat it physically can't fall past.Respectfully, of course.But hey, that's just a theory.A game theory.Thanks for watching.bendy revealed all its lore in a mobilegame in secrets of the machine we'reintroduced to a new character Riley andher tragic

had this plan for 6years who would have thought thatBendy has been on a roll recently. After
a successful sequel at the end of 2022,they announced that a brand new game is coming
this year, and we're getting a movie. Consideringthe franchise had been dormant for four years,
that felt like quite a lot of Bendy in a shortspace of time. So imagine my surprise when out
of nowhere, a different Bendy game dropped onSteam with zero warning or fanfare. And it teased
not one, not two, but three upcoming games. Man.If 2023 was the year of FNAF, then 2024 is
shaping up to be the year of Bendy. But there'smore to this game than just some fun easter eggs.
Hidden inside its inky depths is a story that'snot only disturbing, but it is going to affect
everything we see in the franchise's next biginstallment. Hello Internet! Welcome to Game
Theory, the show that is making a habit ofguzzling down mysterious liquids. And on the menu
today is a big ol' pint of that inky goodness,because Bendy is back. We've got a brand
new game that is full of secrets to find,aptly called Secrets of the Machine. By doing
certain tasks in a specific order, you can unlockteasers for new games,
discover hidden easter eggs,and even get jump scared by the dancing devilhimself. No joke, I actually had this game paused
while I was on a call with our writers discussingwhat this theory would be, and
suddenly, on that pause screen,I get jump scared by Bendy and nearlyfly off my chair. But besides
the pause screen jump scares,what's been cool about this particulargame is that it's being updated every single
day by the developers, with slight changes andalterations adding more hints as to what the lore
of this game truly is. It's been a week since thegame's release at the time of writing, and I'm
still having to go back and change things becausenew secrets are being added, which is great for
teasing fans, but not so great if you're tryingto figure out the story.
But despite the developersworking against me in real time, I think I figuredout what's really going on. The story we're being
told isn't just to tease new games. It's a storyof loss, regret, and an evil corporation that has
taken things too far in the name of innovation.And for once, we're not talking about Joey
Drew. So dive into the ink with me, friends,as we uncover the secrets of the machine. But
just because we're playing in a sepia-toned world,it doesn't mean you also have to dress in simple
blacks and yellows. There's a whole array ofcolors to choose from, and we here at Theorists
are always up for experimenting with our colorsand style. Heck, we made a whole channel
specifically for it, and we've been carryingthat philosophy over into our recent lines of
TheoryWare merch. However, while TheoryWare hasserved us well over the last several years,
as we've continued to grow and experiment,we realize the clothing we've been producing
has evolved beyond traditional merch and intotop-of-the-line products. We're now getting
to work with mega franchises like FNAF, Doom,Godzilla, Poppy Playtime, wink wink, which is
why, as many of you have seen from our Creators inFashion event, we're retiring the TheoryWare name.
But don't worry, something new is ready to takeits place. Our brand new apparel line, Lumen.
It's a line designed to crank up the vibrancyin our lives through color. Lots of color. This
doesn't mean that we're done with the trophy,clickbait green, or working with IPs that are
important to us. We're just mixing it in withthings like this mint green dress. With a unique
asymmetrical design, high neck and shoulder pads,it's unlike anything we've ever designed. And
it's certainly not something you're gonna findin your local store. Or what about this floral
umbrella? I've always found umbrellas to bereally useful and practical, especially in rainy
old London. But it often comes at the cost ofstyle. Well, with Lumen, we said, why not both?
It's a gorgeous shade of mint and has intricatefloral patterns, so you can keep yourself nice
and dry and feel like a model while you do.Finally, no more feeling like a drowned rat
when you get caught out in a sudden shower.Personally, I'm most excited about this ombre
bomber jacket. I love a good jacket. But everybrand just sticks to the same basic colors and
designs. They're afraid to think outside the box,so we just decided to make it ourselves to show
the world that you can mix this many colorstogether and look great on both the runway and
on the street. And if those aren't your speed,don't worry. Our goal with Lumen is to make a
clothing line that has something for everyone.We've got joggers, tees, crewnecks, crop tops,
cardigans, and so much more, all with creativeand colorful designs waiting for you over at

But for now, it's time for us to ditch the colorand take a look at the secrets hiding in Bendy's
latest game. As I've mentioned, this game is verymuch about exploration. You walk into an isolated
house within a black void and through an inkyportal. And once there, you can unlock a bunch
of things just by experimenting. One thing you'reable to do is get cans out of this vending
machine. And so, naturally, most players pickedthem up and started throwing them all over the
place to see what they could break. Which is goodbecause that's actually what the devs want you to
do. Dang it, we've become predictable. It is quitefun though. You can throw cans into this pipe, at
Bendy cutouts, at posters on the wall, literallyanything you can see. Try throwing a can at it
because chances are you'll unlock something. Butthe important one for us today is over here on
the right, where you can find two windows and alocked door. By playing
the games as the developersintended and throwing your can of beans at thelit window, the lights go
out and the door unlocks,taking us to a room with a family portrait frontand center. There's a pencil attached to the
painting and by using it, we can measure ourheight on the wall and see that the person we are
playing as is six years old. Ah, yes, a time fullof innocence and wonder. But don't worry, just
like all Bendy games, our life is about to get awhole lot worse. We hear a car honk and suddenly
blood splatters onto the parents of the familyportrait. There's only one interpretation here.
We lost our parents in a car accident. That wouldbe traumatic for anyone, let alone a six-year-old.
So of course, this sends our character down a verydark path. As we walk into a middle school, we
see a teacher talking to the school psychologistabout us. We're pursuing art, however,our drawings have become twisted
since the accident. Instead ofcute birds and butterflies, we've now taken
to drawing monsters that are scaring the otherstudents. It's also during this conversation we
learn of our character's name, Riley. That's nota name we've heard before in
this franchise, but you know,it's nice to put a name to a POV, I guess.As time goes on, we see one of Riley's drawings
that scared the other kids at school. An angrylooking car with blood pooling underneath it. The
car that killed her parents. At least, that's howRiley sees it. Her trauma is definitely outworking
itself through her art. Though, this character isunusual. Not because it's disturbing, but because
we've seen it before. This is Gasket, and if thatname isn't familiar to you, I'm honestly not
surprised. He was one of the villains you went upagainst in the mobile game, Bendy Nightmare Run.
That's right, Bendy had a mobile game. And I sayhad, because the game is no longer available to
download anywhere, due to a whole host of reasons,including rising costs and lawsuits. So, Gasket's
inclusion here felt like a really weird callback,especially when according to the game's
description, this is a game made of, quote,lost cartoons recently discovered in the dark
vaults of Joey Drew Studios. But Riley doesn'twork for Joey Drew. Or at least, she didn't.
Because after she draws this horrifying car,we get a letter through the door from the one and
only Joey Drew, offering Riley a job. We continueto draw more of the same angry car while at the
studio, only for Riley to get fired from thestudio because of these disturbances. Which
explains why her infamous car was pulled fromthe dark vault of lost cartoons. Joey Drew hid
her work someway, would never see the light of daybecause it was considered too scary. And that's
coming from a company whose mascot is a literaldevil. If you take a look at the rest of the
characters from Nightmare Run, they all seem tofit that description. They're all much angrier,
more violent characters than the cheeky devilthat made the studio famous. Regardless, as we
turn around, there is one final door to walkthrough. And above it reads one word, Gent, the
corporation that made the ink machine in the firstplace, and was seen taking it away in their van
at the end of The Dark Revival. That is where themain story of Secrets of the Machine ends. A
tragic story of trauma that causes nothing butmisfortune for this new character Riley. However,
that isn't where the story ends for us theorists.There is much more going on in this story than
meets the eye. If you take a step back and lookat some of the seemingly random details this game
has to offer us, we can start to figure out thebigger picture. What's going on with this ending?
Why have we been introduced to a new character?And how does it tie into the wider Bendy story?
Well, for starters, it's important to establishthat these events aren't just flying by in quick
succession because the game's artistic. This kindof world manipulation,along with the sepia tone colour scheme
and inky tunnel, is the kind of thingwe'd expect from one place in particular. The
cycle. The cycle is the inky world created bythe ink machine. A world that can be bent and
moulded to the creator's will. We first experiencethe cycle at the very end of Chapter 5 of the
original Bendy and the Ink Machine. Our leadcharacter Henry beat the ink demon and woke up in
Joey Drew's apartment. After some pleasantries,we walk through a door and end up right back
at the start of Chapter 1. Everyone, and I meaneveryone, was confused by this ending. Even to
this day, we still don't really have a full graspof how the cycle works or how people end up there.
What we do know is that it's called the cyclebecause existence here is quite literally a cycle.
A continuous loop that forces people to relive thesame thing over and over again. And any timethe ink demon is defeated by
playing the old movie reelcalled The End, the world resets and everything
begins again. But how does that relate to ournew character Riley? Well,
by completing the story,we also end up starting from the beginning. If weget killed by Gasket immediately after completing
the main story, we're right back at the beginning.Get jump scared by Bendy and, you guessed it,
we're right back at the beginning. This gametakes place inside the cycle. Riley is in the
cycle. And we can see that reflected in thearchway that appears at the beginning of each
playthrough. This archway contains a word orphrase, but it changes each time the cycle resets,showing us a different side
of Riley's personality.Some of them are things like remember or discover,
which makes sense. We're going to the house todiscover secrets and remember the horrible things
that have happened in Riley's past. But then wealso get words that seem to contradict that
sentiment. One of the words that can appear isconceal, a word that literally means not to be
seen. How can we both discover and also conceal?When Henry resets, he doesn't remember
it's a cycle. He has to go through andfigure out what's going on, hence remember
and discover. However, in future playthroughs,using the seeing tool, you can find messages
presumably from past Henry's warning this currentHenry about what's to come. He was able to learn
about what this place was and he's trying to stophis future self from suffering the same fate.
And if Riley is also continuing to go throughthe cycle, uncovering more and more secrets,
revealing more and more of her horrible past,like the death of her parents, the rejection of
teachers and her firing from Joey Drew studios,I don't think she'd want her future self to
remember any of this. She'd want to keep ithidden, to conceal it. And who could blame
her? I thought Henry's loops sucked, but yikes.We also end up getting words like real life and
illusion. Obviously real is spelt like film real,because I mean, who doesn't love a good pun? But
if you take out the pun and focus on it being reallife as in it is real, then we end up with two
more phrases that are opposites. It would alignwith what Henry expressed when he's in the cycle,
trying to figure out whether the whole thing isreal or fake. Riley is going through that exact
same experience. The world around her is weirdand mysterious, constantly
shifting with charactersand objects appearing and disappearing. It'd benatural for her to assume it's all an illusion.
But as with Henry, this is all very, very real.Then there's this final word, regret. What exactly
does Riley regret? The death of her parents?Wasn't exactly her fault. Does she regret the
drawings that caused her to lose her job? Maybe.Although I actually think the word is more
closely connected to the ending of Riley's story.She ends up walking through a Gent door,
presumably meaning that after her firingfrom Joey Drew Studios, she ended up at Gent.
She sees a black container and upon interactingwith it, the cycle resets. But while that's where
our game loop ends, that last detail tells us aheck of a lot about what happened to Riley after
this final moment. Since Bendy and the DarkRevival, it's been clear that Gent were more than
just the creators of the ink machine. They hadsome ulterior motives. While Joey Drew Studios
was going bankrupt, the Gent Corporation is whatkept them afloat. Later on in the story, we hearthis audio log and it makes Gent's
ulterior motives crystal clear.And then, once you finally do walk into the
Gent building during Bendy and the Dark Revival,you'll find a number of those bodies under
tarps with black ink staining the sheets.Gent were advertising jobs to people in order
to use them as research subjects. People whowere desperate and needed money. People that were
criminals, homeless, or just couldn't keep a job.People like Riley. In Secrets of the Machine,
by shooting some cans into an overhanging pipe,you can access the theatre. And if you throw
another can at the screen, you begin to see avideo that doesn't really fit anything we've
seen before. It uses real footage of eyes,tentacles, dripping ink, along with the words
REJECT, SUBMIT, and of course, GENT. This appearsto be showing us exactly what these experiments
were. Gent experimenting with what the specialink from the ink machine does to a person.
Will it submit to its magical, sentient will,or will their bodies reject it? Leading to
another failed experiment and another dead body.We see a similar thing happen elsewhere
in the franchise. And now, we get to do myfavorite thing ever. Talk about the
books. Woooo! Party poppers! Woooo!Originally, the authors said that the books
were actually full-blown canon to the games,but now, theMeatly, the series creator,
has come out with this tweet. Quote,In regards to Bendy books and content outside of
the games, I've always viewed them as fun extrasfor people who want more from the universe. The
super talented authors and artists who work onthem are given freedom to make things their
own. To me, the games decide the canon.The books kind of live in this nebulous space
between canon and not canon. That doesn't meanthat information we get from the books is wasted,
however. Books like this are often a place for thewriters and developers to experiment, to test out
ideas and plant seeds in the minds of the audienceto see what sticks and what doesn't. The stuff
that does work might then have a chance to workinto the games. And so I wanted to bring this
stuff up because I think that might be what we'restarting to see here. Do you guys remember the
insane cultish ink man from the first game SammyLawrence? Well, in the book Dreams Come to Life,
we learn a bit more about his backstory as thedirector of the music department for Jerry Drew
Studios. He ends up accidentally consuming someof the ink machine's magical ink when a pipe
bursts. He immediately becomes addicted todrinking the stuff, and it slowly drives him
insane, eventually leading to him becoming theblack inky demon worshipping version we see in
the very first game. Just like the ink machine canturn human souls and drawings into living versions
of characters, the ink from the ink machine hasthe ability to physically change people into
inky monsters. That is what Jent seems to beexperimenting with, and Riley was
one of those experiments. Remember,these are her memories we'recycling through, so seeing that video of an
experiment happening to someone, it feels likeit's her replaying the moment back to herself.
She's only remembering quick flashes of thehorrible things she's experienced as her mind
tries to forget and conceal them. Plus, if you gointo the game's Steam page, you'll see this in
the description. Quote, subject number 131389145.Property of the Jent Corporation. No unauthorized
viewing or interaction. Danger. Unstable. Thisconfirms that the story we're experiencing isfrom a Jent experiment. You
don't just give a video filea subject number for no reason. Riley is subject
131389145. When she walked into Jent at the end ofthat story, it's not because she works for Jent,
but instead she's a young adult down on her luckthat needed money to stay afloat after losing her
dream job, and Jent were happy to provide that,so long as she was willing to be part of a little
experiment. That container we interact with at theend is ink from the ink machine. She's asked to
consume it as part of the experiment to see if itwould change her, and now they're observing and
recording what happens. That's why the archwaysigns keep changing to words like conceal and
regret. She doesn't want to keep reliving thesememories and regrets the decisions she made to get
there, but there's nothing she can do. She's stuckrepeating it over and over and over again,
completely helpless, while Jent just stand thereand watch. Or at least, I thought she was
completely helpless, but there's one detail thatcaught my attention. The
name of the building. It'scalled the drawing board, which on the surfacejust sounds like a reference to Riley's artistic
roots, but in reality, I think it has a doublemeaning. The phrase back to the drawing board
means that you've attempted something, but it wasunsuccessful, so you're going back to the start in
order to try again. Riley is constantly going backto where it all began. The car accident, the
firings, the submission to Jent's experiment.However, this name tells us that she is refusing
to sit there resigned to her fate. She's literallygoing back to the drawing board each time she
resets to see if some other change will affectthe outcome. We were warned that this game was
considered unstable, which also implies that Jentaren't the ones controlling what's happening
inside the game, despite being labelled as thedevelopers. They aren't the ones changing the
arrangement of items inside the house. It's Rileytrying desperately to change her fate, to find a
way to break out of her cycle. Ultimately, I thinkshe'll end up succeeding, at least partially
anyway. When you enter the main room of thedrawing board, you're greeted with a banner that
once again can have a couple of messages, but themost common one I've encountered is this. Escape
your cage. Obviously this feels like a message forRiley, encouraging her to keep going and to
try again to break free. But the word choice isinteresting. While cage reflects a place where
an animal or a test subject would be trapped,just like Riley is, it's also the name of the
next big installment of the Bendy franchise.The cage was teased late last year, but other
than a short teaser and a couple of screenshots,we know nothing about this game. Which I guess
seems to be the marketing approach for most Bendygames these days. The only thing we do know is
that this game takes place during Bendy and theDark Revival, between when Audrey visits Henry in
the Genk Corporation building, and Henry and therest of the gang arriving during the final battle
to help her. The only other detail we have arethese Lost Ones that are trying to attack us. Lost
Ones have been enemies for us in basically everyinstallment of the Bendy franchise. Although they
have personalities, they appear to be living in aconstant state of suffering, slowly driving them
insane and in turn, becoming hostile to anyone whothey come across. Exactly like what happens to
Sammy when he becomes addicted and transformedby the ink in the books. This is the fate of those
who were part of Gent's experiments, or the oneswho submitted to the ink that is. But these Lost
Ones we see in the cage teasers are different.Unlike normal Lost Ones that are completely made
up of goopy black ink, these ones have skeletonsshowing, and weird apparatus around their skulls.
It looks like something straight out of the Sawfranchise, but if the Lost Ones are experiments
created by Gent, then this apparatus does looklike something you might use as part of an
experiment. Also, the place Henry is escapingfrom in the cage is known as the Pit, which is
found inside the Gent building. So seeing moreGent experiments in that particular area isn't all
that surprising. But the most noticeable detailis that amongst the usual black ink is also some
kind of red liquid mixed in. The only time we'veseen any colours in this world other than the
black and sepia yellow is from Wilson in Bendyand the Dark Revival. He was trying to bring his
new character Shippahoy Dudley to life, and to doso he was using multicoloured ink. The final
creation was still a mostly black and yellowmonster, but with streams of rainbow coloured
ink leaking out of him. But that's not what we'reseeing here. It's just red. There are no other
colours mixed in, and it's worked into theirbodies rather than leaking out of them like blood.
That tells me these aren't connected to Wilson,but someone else. Someone that specifically
uses red ink. Someone like Riley. When she drawsGasket, she uses red ink to draw blood underneath
it. She's been told that her designs are toocreepy, and I don't know about you, but these
new Lost Ones are way creepier than what we'veseen previously. She has to be connected to
this in some way. I'm not entirely sure how,but we do see a bunch of coffins building up
outside the drawing board. In both the gamesand the books, for the ink to take, the person
needs to be living. They need to submit to theink and not reject it. But as we heard from
that audio log, a lot of the experiments fromGen don't work out and they just end up with a
bunch of dead bodies. But here, death is like away of life. A clockwork march. Given that these
new Lost Ones have skeletons showing, they lookmore like the dead race to life than a living
being corrupt by ink. It's almost as if thoserejected bodies are what ends up in those coffins.
And from there, Riley is able to take these failedexperiments and give them new life, thanks
to her red ink and twisted imagination.It may even have something to do with the Bendy
summoning circle that is slowly being drawn onthe floor of the hidden room in the back. Is she
using it as part of her creation process? Or isit to summon Bendy to help her escape this cycle?
Sammy Lawrence drew the same circle to try andsummon the ink demon in the original Bendy, and
he's also due to return in this upcoming game.So I wouldn't be surprised if these two are
connected, working together as a force to stopHenry as he tries to defeat Bendy and help Audrey.
I mean, Henry was the partner of Joey Drew afterall, the man who fired Riley and led her down a
path towards djent, the experiments, and beingstuck in the cycle in the first place. Riley
doesn't want to escape. She wants revenge.But hey, that's just a theory. A
game theory. Thanks for watching.And if you're interested in seeing more of the

Although I actually think Matt had the right idea because it is now my turn to jump into the mysterious abyss that is Roblox DoorsA game set in an abandoned hotel where to win, you have to, get this, walk through doors.I know, SHOCKING!Though on the surface it might sound pretty simple, things escalate pretty quickly.There's demonic entities that are trying to stop us, a homunculus made of flesh andbone known as The Figure that sabotages our only means of escape, and there's a bunchof extra rooms called The Rooms, yeah they like to keep their naming conventions simple here.However, in The Rooms, it no longer means you have 100 doors to go through, but a thousand.It's actually quite a challenge.Fortunately, through most of this, there's a mysterious blue sparkle that is trying tohelp us escape.This is Guiding Light, and they offer us advice when we die, show us the path duringthe chase sequences, and offer us tools like the Crucifix to stop entities dead in their tracks.We believed in previous theories that Guiding Light was the one manipulating the halls ofthe hotel into the random arrangement you encounter in each run, confusing and trappingthe entities within.Sadly though, they aren't able to help us all the time.Once you enter The Rooms, their power fades, but there is a similar yellow light entitywaiting for us, they're just less helpful.We learn that this spirit is named Curious Light, although their name leaves a littleto be desired, as they don't seem as much curious as they do aloof.They refuse to give us hints, and yet they want us to keep trying.Here's a thought, maybe give me a hint and I'll do better next time.Curious Light's actions don't seem to make a lot of sense.That was, until I played the latest update, known simply as The Backdoor Update.We suspected that Curious Light was actually trying to escape The Rooms, with the finaldoor leading to a bunch of other open doors floating in a void.Other dimensions, as proven by the appearance of Bob the Skeleton, who is actually froman entirely different Roblox game, and whose name tag we can find in The Rooms.It felt like Curious Light wanted access to this room in order to escape and explore moreworlds, and it seems like we were right.Because in Backdoors, Curious Light is back, no longer stuck in The Rooms, and this timethey are actually trying to help us.We've got a new speedrun challenge on our hands, as we've got to go from door minus50 to door 0 in just one minute.That is not a lot of time.It's almost as if they don't want us snooping around for lore.But fear not friends, even with the dreaded time limit, I was able to uncover the secretsthis little update had for us, how it connects to everything we know so far, and what itcould mean for the Floor 2 update that's coming soon.So grab your Vials of Starlight and drink up theorists, we're about to unlock evenmore door lore.Matt was right, that is satisfying to say.A cool detail to kick us off with is how you access the Backdoor Update inside the game itselfMuch like the main game, you stand in an elevator and it will take you to the first floor ofyour next run.In this case, door minus 50.However, you can't just walk straight into this new elevator.If you're new to doors, you'll find that the Backdoor's elevator is blocked bya barrier of yellow light.At this point, if something glows yellow, we know it has to be related to Curious Light,matching their yellow sparkles and death screens from the rooms.Sure enough, if you unlock the achievement completing the rooms, the first place we encounterCurious Light and head back to the lobby, you'll find the Backdoor's elevator issuddenly open to you.Curious Light was stuck in the rooms, but now he's been freed by us completing thatfinal door, allowing him to escape into the hotel's version of the back rooms.That act alone seems to have given Curious Light a change of heart.In the past, Curious Light didn't seem interested in helping us escape, and yet in this newupdate they seem to be doing exactly that.When dying from Haste, the entity that comes when the timer runs out, Curious Light willsay this.They're referring to the levers that you find around the Backdoor's map that addtime back to your clock, sometimes even up to a full minute.Without those, you literally cannot beat this new update, plus not only have they addeda way to give you more time, but much like Guiding Light, they've also added an itemto help us out, one that can regenerate our health and help us move faster.This item is called Vial of Starlight, it's yellow, and the primary symbol inside thevial is a star, which matches the sparkles we've seen from Curious Light.Curious Light has given us the only method available to beat this dang update, completelychanging their attitude towards us.But why the change?Because being in The Rooms felt hopeless.It was a thousand doors, there was no way anyone could win, so why bother?They wanted to escape, but they just didn't see it happening.Until it did.We beat The Rooms and let Curious Light out into the basement of the hotel.Suddenly there was a chance.If we can do that, if we can beat a thousand rooms, what else are we capable of?What else could we help them achieve?And so, they've perked up, realizing that we might be able to help them get what they want.And what is it they want?Well, if you do manage to get to the end of the back doors, you'll find a final doormarked 0000.Proceeding through this door starts a short cutscene where the door begins to break openwith a yellow light and suddenly you are back in the hotel lobby with an empty doorframebehind you, covered in yellow cracks and Curious Light's symbol.Last time it seemed like Curious Light wanted to access multiple realities, with all thosedifferent doors floating in the void in room A-1000, but now he seems determined to getinto the main hotel.They've once again used us to open a door that they can't open themselves, and we'veled it straight to their desired destination.He even leaves a bottle of Starlight, a larger version of the vials we've been collecting,as a sort of thank you, before we enter the final door.However, while I've been suspicious of Curious Light and their motives, there was somethingelse in this update that gave me pause.When you die, Curious Light gives you breakdowns of the entity that killed you, like they didin the rooms, but their tone has once again changed.In the rooms, they didn't really have a name for anything, they just said things likeBut now, they're offering more solid opinions.He does have names for these things, he's actually giving you his attention, exceptfor one specific entry.One of these new entities is called Blitz, which is a modified version of Rush from theBut if you die to it, Curious Light says this.Who is she?We've never encountered a she before.But whoever she is, Curious Light seems to recognise her authority.He doesn't question her, he just tells us exactly what he's been told.No opinions, no wisecracks, just direct answers.And if this she is telling Curious Light about the entities, is she the one behind everything?Pulling the strings?I've got some good news for you theorists, because I believe we know who this characteris, and it all comes down to this symbol and this painting.This symbol is the binding circle that appears when using the crucifix on an entity.We've examined this before and broken down the different parts of the circle to figureout exactly what it's doing, like the Star of Solomon in the middle that became associatedwith the occult and demons, which makes sense when it literally traps the demonic entitieswe find throughout the hotel.But there's one part that we didn't talk about, the ring of symbols around the Starof Solomon.The ring of symbols are wingdings, and if you convert that text to a normal Englishfont and then run it through a Caesar cipher, you'll get the message:Given that this is on the binding circle when using a crucifix, an item that glows blueand traps the entities in a blue light, I think it's pretty safe to say that the architectit's referring to is Guiding Light.Until now, we've been referring to Guiding Light as an angelic being, due to the sword-bearingangel statue in the courtyard, as well as other religious imagery.However, we did get this tweet from one of the developers, saying,And this translation of wingdings would certainly suggest that too, with Guiding Light not beingan angel, but an otherworldly being known as an architect.But does that mean that using religious imagery to figure out the lore of this game is immediately debunked?I don't think so.Firstly, other than terminology, it feels like we were kind of on the right track with Guiding Light.We suspected Guiding Light was an angel twisting the halls of the hotel to trap the demonic entities.An architect is someone who builds and designs buildings, so Guiding Light being named anarchitect makes sense, as they are the one changing the building.We may not have been right about the terminology used for Guiding Light, but we ended up ata similar conclusion because we found some religious influence.And that word influence is important, because what I showed you isn't the full tweet.It continues,The developers aren't denying that they're taking inspiration from religion, just thatit's not inherently a religious story.And here's the thing, we actually see this religious inspiration through the binding circle translated text.It implies there are beings above the architects that give them power in some way.They are marked by them.These beings are referred to as celestials.This word is often used to mean something up high, and in astronomy, it refers to thingsin space, like the term celestial body.But celestials derive from the Latin word caelem, meaning heaven, and was originallyused to refer to heavenly beings or angels.So while Guiding Light and Curious Light might not be angels themselves, we might beencountering some otherworldly beings at some point, the celestials.The space theme continues when we have a look at the painting we can find on floor 60.This floor is where we find the secret passage to the rooms, where Curious Light resides,and it's the only place where this painting appears.The image is named Spacetime, which again, seems to be referring to the spacey, otherworldlythemes that we've already talked about, especially when you take a look at the symbols.The one in the center matches the yellow sparkle we've seen representing Curious Light acrossthe various rooms and doors.It also matches the symbol found in the vials of starlight provided by Curious Light.In the top right corner, we have a blue crescent moon.Now, if the center symbol is meant to be Curious Light, then it would make sense for the bluesymbol to be Guiding Light.It guides us through the hotel with a blue light, and when we use the items gifted tous by Guiding Light, like the crucifix, the symbols that banish the entities are also blue.And would you look at that!At the center of the binding circle is a symbol, a crescent moon, the same symbol that appearsin the painting.This is the symbol of Guiding Light, one of the three architects, and with there beingthree symbols on this painting, I have a sneaking suspicion that means Curious Light is alsoanother one of these architects.But there's one more symbol in this picture.In the bottom right corner, there's a red symbol that you might not be familiar with.This symbol only appears in the game when you add modifiers.Essentially, modifiers are designed to make the game more challenging, but in turn, youget higher rewards.They can do things like make the floors more slippery, give you less health at the startof the game, and make entities move faster or appear more frequently.When you activate modifiers, this red symbol appears on the screen, the same red symbolthat's in the painting.Given there are no other symbols on this painting, this has to be our third architect that theCrucifix Wingdings told us about, the one that Curious Light is referencing when itsays she.Suddenly, this line from Curious Light makes sense.This new architect knows Blitz's name, because modifiers are literally able to change thebehavior of the entities in the hotel.She has power over them.She can make them more aggressive, and what's worse, she seems to have power over the other architects.There's a mod that literally deactivates Guiding Light's "guiding light" from Seek'sChase sequence, making that challenge much harder.If you die during the main game with modifiers active, Guiding Light will not appear on thedeath screen to help you out, and then, if you reach door 60, you will be unable to enterThe Rooms.It is completely blocked off to you by this mysterious red force, the same color as theforce of this final architect.She is the most powerful architect we've encountered, able to control the entitieswithin the hotel and alter the hotel itself, overriding any control Guiding Light has.She is so powerful that Curious Light doesn't question her or her authority.That makes her a scary force to deal with, and I have a feeling that we're going tobe dealing with her a lot more in the coming updates.We've been waiting patiently for the Doors Floor 2 update, but back in October, we finallygot a sneak peek of what's to come.We're achieving the milestone of 4 billion visits, that's billion with a B. The developersgave us a teaser image for Floor 2, known simply as The Mines.Now, I have to say a huge congratulations to the developers, 4 billion is a massiveachievement and it's incredibly well deserved, but when I saw this image, I immediately startedtrying to figure out what it meant for the story going forward.What inspiration did the developers take to go down this mineshaft route?I did find a few hotels that have rooms in old mineshafts, one of them is even quiteclose to me, it's just over in Wales, but there didn't seem to be anything specialabout them, they just felt like gimmicks designed to trap tourists and travel vloggers withunique experiences.However, now that I have the additional piece that is this new architect, I found somethingthat not only ties into our previous theories, but gives us a little more information aboutwhat we can expect inside the mines.In our initial theories, we spoke about the main entity of Doors, The Figure, a creaturemade of flesh and bones which stood out against the other black, inky or ghostly entitiesof the hotel.Based on the use of religious and occult imagery found in the game, like the binding circle,we determined that The Figure was a homunculus, a version of a human being created not bynatural means, but through occult alchemy.Typically these were made by mixing human flesh, bones and teeth, and through the finaldoor, where The Figure chases us to the elevator, we see piles of flesh throughout the level.This all led us to believe that the next update would take us deep underground, where we'dfind the origins of The Figure, the place that the cult that created it originally resided.Now that we know that Floor 2 takes place in a mine, I started looking into whetherthere were any cults that took refuge in mines.It feels like something we see in fiction all the time, but when it came to reality,there was only one very specific answer that I found.In Bolivia, there are groups that worship a spirit that lives in the mines.This spirit is called El Tio, and though his appearance looks like the Christian Devil,El Tio is an ambivalent spirit, capable of giving both wealth and destruction.The miners would worship El Tio, building a shrine inside the mine and providing offeringsto him in order to receive safety.They'd offer things like alcohol, cigarettes, coca leaves, even the blood of llamas.The miners would then light a minecart on fire full of these offerings and push thecart deep into the mines, never to be seen again.Which is interesting, as we also see a single minecart being pushed down into a deep holein the recent teaser for the Mines update.Could this have been a hole for sacrifices?There were also specific rules you had to follow if you were going into the mines andworshipping El Tio, namely what you could or couldn't bring with you when you wentin or out of the mines.Up until 2009, Bolivia was an official Catholic nation, and the majority of its residentsstill are Catholics today.So unsurprisingly, worshipping a devil-like being wasn't really liked by the CatholicChurch.Due to this conflict between the miners and the Church, certain rules were followed whengoing in and out of the mines.Specifically, no Catholic imagery like crucifixes were allowed inside the mines, and no El Tioimagery was allowed outside the mines.The outside world was God's domain, but the mines, the underground, belonged to El Tio.The two were not allowed to mix, which feels very similar to what we're seeing in Doors.In this space-time painting, we see both Guiding Light and this new light, but they are onopposite sides of the painting.They are being shown as diametrically opposed.They cannot coexist, which is why when you activate modifiers, Guiding Light can no longerhelp you.If you want Guiding Light's assistance, you have to remove the modifiers.They cannot be in the same place at the same time.Now again, we know that Doors isn't going for a directly religious story, only takinginspiration from it, and that's what I think we're seeing here.It seems to me like the mines and this new architect might at least partially be inspiredby the mines of Bolivia and the cult of El Tio that lies within.Which means that Guiding Light is going to be of no use to us in this new update.We're likely not going to be able to bring our candle or our crucifix with us, and evenif we are, I doubt they're going to have any effect.Much like we saw when we entered Curious Light's domain in the rooms.This is her domain, and Guiding Light is not welcome.The question is, is that a bad thing?El Tio isn't an evil spirit.It can be good or bad depending on how you treat it.We see that in how the modifiers work.The game may get harder, but we get more rewards out of it if we succeed.So while she seems like an opposing force to Guiding Light, who is the one that hasbeen helping us so far, this new architect isn't inherently evil or against us.They may have power over the entities we've encountered so far, but we have no idea whatawaits us in the mines.And much like in the mines of Bolivia, working with her might be our only chance of survivingwhatever new threat awaits us.And then, what happens when Curious Light is thrown into the mix?We freed him into the hotel after the backdoor's update, so I could see him coming down tothe mines as well.He seems to get along with this new architect in some way, or at least, they've been inthe same place long enough for her to start bossing him around.Maybe he'll offer us some much needed assistance, that or he'll just mock us the entire timefor dying.I guess we'll just have to wait and see what happens when the Floor 2 update finallyreleases.But hey, that's just a theory, a Game Theory.Thanks for watching.And if you wanted to

that'swhat we all thought untiltoday hello Internet welcome to GameTheory where it is finally time today Igraduate from FNAF boy to FNAF man andtake on my very first FNAF Theoryalthough I say that I have actually beenhelping Matt write FNAF theories for thepast 3 years thanks Tom thanks safeflight back I didn't get to talk to youabout Gregory as a robot all right Imean to be fair that was both of our sinbut you know I threw something out myfirst math the I threw something outthere Gregor is a robot first FNAFTheory and look how well received it'sbeen look how good that's gone for allof us it's done so well for all of usyeah what could possibly go wrong butdon't worry theorists I promise today'stheory is way less crazy hopefullybecause today I'm going to be tacklingone simple teeny tiny detail that Ithink is really important tounderstanding this franchise H Wanted 2was full of Collectibles most of whichyou get from a prize machine after youbeat a mini game some are set prizesthat relate to the level you justcompleted like a sun figure for beatingthe first daycare Mission or a meatpretzel for beating the Fazbear theaterhowever after you beat the game thereare some extra prizes to collect thatare given to you at random when youreplay a stage usually this is justextra plushies models or food butsometimes you get posters and one one ofthese posters stood out above all therest it ends up on the back wall rightnext to the Faz wrench entrance for theprincess Quest mini game it's a posterpromoting fallfest 1970 now to the FNAFCommunity fallfest is nothing new wefirst saw this name pop up almost 5years ago in the curse of dread bad DLCfor the original had wanted a Halloweeninspired event full of attractions ridesand of course spooky versions of all ourfavorite characters to fit in with theHalloween theme but there is one crucialdifference between this fo Fest and theone we see on the post from help wantedto the date the banners around the curseof dreadbear Hub World showed that thisevent was taking place in 1983 but thisnew poster is from over a decade beforethis whole fallfest thing has clearlybeen running for a very long time infact it's been running since before theearliest confirmed parts of the FNAFtimeline in the silver eyes when Charlieis looking for news articles onfredbear's Family Diner she starts thesearch at 1979 seeming to imply thatthis was when the dino was founded butthat is nine whole years after afterthis poster was published and that's notall look at the design of this posterwhile it's advertising forfest it's notinherently spooky like the event we seefor the curse of dreadbear instead ithas ainal elements but it's mostlydesigned to look like an old two-tonecircus poster complete with a giantcircus tent right in the middle and thisisn't the first time steel will hasoffered us hints that circuses might beimportant to this franchise there's themini games in H22 like the Carousel andfazer blast there's the circus costumesthat are down in the basement of Ruinthere's even circus themed Funko merchclearly Steel Ste will is beating usover the head with this circus thing fora reason but why well back in 2022 inthe buildup to security breach's XboxPort steel will did an interview withgame jolt to talk about how they madesecurity breach give some updates onruins development and drop some littlehints towards what might be coming downthe pipeline for them and the FNAFfranchise and when asked what kind ofgame they'd like to make in the futurethey said this one thing that I've I'vealways would love to do is get back tokind of like the origin of like fazarentertainment kind of see how thingswere made same here I'd like to headfurther back into the 70s they want tocreate a game about the origins ofFreddy's set in the' 70s most of us atthe time assumed this would just befredbear's Family Diner but with allthis circus imagery popping up it begsthe question what if fredbear's FamilyDiner wasn't the origin of Freddy's WhatIf instead it was this circus forfest1970 and once I realized that thingsstarted to fall into place this posteris the key to clarifying some massiveholes in the FNAF timeline it confirms anumber of things we've been predictingfor a while and it shines a little morelight on the franchise's latest villaincome to think of it maybe this isn'tsuch a small Theory after all whoops soyou better grab your popcorn theoristbecause the show is about to begin andI'm going to reveal to you the trueorigins of Freddy's but just before weget into that I need to talk to youabout something else that's reallyimportant it's something you may haveseen if you watch our own sisterlocation style Theory but we have anexciting theorist event coming up we areputting on a fashion show it's calledcreate hater in fashion and it is thefirst of its kind not just because afashion show has never been done onYouTube before although that is prettycool but because we're getting weirdwith it how weird well the first Runwayof the night is going to be FNAF themedyou heard that right we've had FNAFgames a FNAF movie A FNAF cookbook andnow FNAF is completing the theoristGauntlet and getting a FNAF Runwayalthough if you've ever bought a highquality FNAF merch FNAF being highfashion may not be that surprising butwhat might be surprising is whatcreators we have planned for the eventit's called creators in fashion afterall so we wanted to make sure we werespotlighting creators from all cornersof the internet and make this oneof akind event even more special we've gotthe likes of zhc seek discomfort Cassieho and critical role all getting glammedup to strut their stuff we've got simplyneological providing nails for the eventand the whole thing is going to becommentated by Rosanna

has a lot more surprisesfor you guys up those Lacy sleeves soremember that's April 25th 2:30 p.m. PSTright here on Game Theory I'll see youthere but for now let's Get Off TheRunway and head back to the circus now Iunderstand there may be some hesitancyin me changing up the entire beginningof the timeline I get it it's a prettybig claim and while there have been anumber of hints towards circusesthroughout the games and books itdoesn't necessarily mean that's wherethis whole thing started so let's take alook at one of the more recent examplesof the circus being hinted at so I canshow you where I'm coming from in thebasement of the ruined DLC where youfind the mimic there are two costumeshanging up an old lady Blackbird and anelephant dressed as a clown in the gamefiles there's also a lion wearing avarsity jacket three animals allassociated with the circus elephantsoften perform tricks lions wereregularly tamed by lion Tamers and whilecrows or black birds aren'ttraditionally circus animals they dooften appear in Circus focused medialike Disney's Dumbo plus the elephant isliterally dressed as a clown it doesn'tget more circusy than that but the mostimportant part isn't actually theircircus theming it's the fact they aren'tanimatronic suits in our initial theoryon ruin we talked about how thesecostumes seem to be related to Circusbabies because you know circus howeverwhen circus baby's entertainment andrentals or even circus baby's Pizzaworld was due to launch they were allanimatronics and complex ones at thatwhy then would they have physicalcostumes they wouldn't unless thesecostumes actually came from somethingCircus theme that was beforeanimatronics were part of this franchisein the mimic not the robot the talesfrom the pizzza Plex story named afterhim we learn of a character named Edwinwho owns a robotics company getting bigoff of making a robot vacuum cleanerhowever with the birth of his son thedeath of his wife and then the cripplingpressure of running his own business hedecides to sell the company to noneother than Fazbear entertainment whydoes Fazbear agree to purchase becausethey want Edwin for his roboticsknowledge specifically they want him toturn their character costumes intofull-blown animatronics we've seen himdo exactly this with chica in the firstfew pages of the story later on he goeson to explain that this is the 18thcharacter he'd been asked to createdescribing the collection as quotes acircus-like array of animal and othercharacter costumes circus like you saywe believed for a long time that Edwinis the book's parallel for Henry theanimatronic genius that helped Afton togrow Fazbear into the animatronic Empirewe know today so the circus themedcostumes we see in the basement of Ruinlikely came from that same time period aperiod where Henry was transformingcostumes into animatronics and thesecostumes aren't Henry's only connectionto the circus either when Charlie goesback to her childhood home in the silvereyes she looks through Henry's officeand finds an assortment of books thatquote would have seemed eclectic toanyone who didn't know the man therewere books on biology and Anatomy someon human beings others on animals therewere books about the history of thetraveling Carnival and of the circusthere were books about Child Developmentabout myths and legends and about sewingpatterns and techniques there werevolumes that claimed to be about trickstto gods about quilting bees and aboutfootball cheering squads and theirmascots most of these make a lot ofsense things like Anatomy mascot sewingpatterns it all ties into the idea thathe was creating characters and turningcostumes into animatronics the booksabout Child Development either tie intothe fact that he was catering to kidsand so was trying to figure out how hecould best serve his customers or it'slinked to the human anatomy books andties into Henry creating robot versionsof his daughter Charlie but there's oneselection that has always stood out asodd one that I've never had anexplanation for and that is the historyof the traveling Carnival of the circuswhy would Henry need books on that topicif all the work he's ever done is onanimatronics and diners he needs itbecause the origins of Fazbear arerooted in traveling circuses andcarnivals it was a hint as to the firstyears of this business so this circusforfest seems to be where fazarentertainment All Began but now thequestion is who else was there and Idon't mean human characters let's behonest we don't have many of them thatare actually important especially notback in 1970 I mean which of the Fazbearcharacter were part of the originalroster as I've mentioned during H one 2we get a number of mini gamess that takeplace in carnival like settings namelyfazza blast and the Carousel and it'sthe carousel that I want us to take alook at first the game itself is prettystraightforward you know when you don'thave an ash trying to desperately keepyour microphone attached oh my God oh myGod but despite this Matt did manage tonotice a very interesting detail in thelevel's design a random pumpkin justsitting there waiting to be thrown Ithink we can all agree that pumpkins aresomething we specifically associate withHalloween and the only event we know totake place at Halloween in thisfranchise is you guessed it full Fest weeven get a Halloween themed version ofmoon appear during the nightmare levelof the Carousel Ride the carousel isfrom fallfest which means it's from theearly part of the franchise but thentake a look at the characters that areused on the carousel Freddy Bonnie Chicafoxy which you know is what you'd expectexcept it's not just the originalversions from FNAF 1 the one thatimmediately stands out to me is thiswhite and pink version of Foxy Funtimefoxy well kind of because you might alsonotice it has a hooked hand somethingthat Funtime foxy is clearly lacking inSister location however there is aversion of Funtime foxy with a hook hatand that's in FNAF World a game thatcame out before sister location anddoesn't have any other Funtimeanimatronics present implying thatFuntime foxy didn't originally belongwith that group of animatronics insteadbelonging to an earlier set and thisCarousel tells us exactly which groupthat is the other characters on thisride besides Funtime foxy and theoriginal four all have rosy red cheekswhich aligns with the toy animatronicsfrom FNAF 2 toy Freddy toy Bonny toyChica and Funtime Foxy the toy versionof Foxy the toy animatronics being herefeels wrong doesn't it the toys don'tbecome a thing until 1987 with theirspecial recognition software and newmore complex endoskeletons they replacedthe old withered versions of theoriginal Freddy Bonnie Chica and Foxyfrom the original Freddy's how then arethey on a ride from 197 well this isbecause I don't think the toyanimatronics are meant to call back tothe 1983 Freddy's animatronics they'resupposed to be referencing the originalcircus costumes going back to the mimicStory Once Edwin abandons the warehouseFazbear employees are sent in to collectany Fazbear property things like theircostumes one character mentions a few ofthem a brown Freddy Fazbear costume ayellow chica costume a foxy costume aBonnie costume the original four wereall in existence as costumes beforetheir introduction as animatronics atFreddy Faz pizza and what's even crazieris the designs of those costumesactually exist a few years ago there wasa let's just say controversial but atthe time official FNAF artist thatdropped an image onto the FNAF subredditwith zero context or explanation theonly thing we knew is that these imagescontained Scott's official copyrightthese images were commissioned by Scottwhich makes them as good a piece ofevidence as any and what are theseimages of versions of Freddy Bonnie andChica in a similar style to the mascotcostumes you'd find at a theme park likeDisneyland all with large proportionsand big round heads in order to have ahuman fit inside them these appear to bethe original costumes for the charactersand where were these costumes used Isuspect they were worn at the circus whywell notice the bright red cheeksexaggerated features like big red nosesor cheeks have been used by clowns andcircus performers for centuries Josephgaldi is recognized as being theancestor for modern clowns and in 1802he created the design for his mosticonic character Joey the Clown and oneof this characters iconic features waspainted red cheeks similarly Albertfalini is known to have helped redefinea type of clown in the mid 1900s knownas the August clown complete with thebright red nose we know today why didboth these performers feel it necessaryto have bright red features for theevolution of the clown because when theword clown was first recorded in 1560 itmeant rustic bore or peasant this oftenboiled down to one simple stereotype thetown drunk who you would often see afteryou'd had a bit too much to drink with abright red nose and red cheeks thishappens when your body isn't able todigest alcohol properly causing arelease of histamines that essentiallycause your face to have an allergicreaction namely red cheeks and nose theidea of referencing this was to makeclowns or characters immediately lookfoolish silly or disarming so peoplewould be quicker to laugh at them ratherthan be scared of them which is prettyironic when you think about it that iswhy I believe these costumes are circuscostumes not because they're trying tomake characters look like drunks thatwouldn't be very child friendly it wasto invoke those same reactions of Slygoofy fun and the kicker is you can seethis trait carried over into the mostdefinitively circus costume we've gotavailable elephant costume down in theruined basement usually you don't get achance to see them up close but freezethe frame just right or you know searchthe game files and you'll find thatalthough a little faded it too has rosyred cheeks so red cheek characters likethe ones we see in these designs wouldhave been right at home at a circuswhich also opens up the door to otherred cheek characters from this franchiseto potentially be part of the originalroster maybe characters that weren'toriginally animal costumes but morelikely humans wearing the same kind offace paint case and point balloon boyhello balloon boy has never really fitin anywhere we turned on FNAF 2 and hewas just there and we've hated him eversince I said readthe but in security breach he got hisown arcade cabinet balloon world and ifyou played that game you'd see a circustent in the background balloon boy'sonly Standalone Adventure places him atthe circus but while he never fit inwith FNAF 2 new characters he did have astriking resemblance to a handful ofcharacters in Sister location and circusbabies other wooden puppets like themagician and fortune teller all jobsthat would be found at a circus sellingballoons was an important part of anycircus so balloon boy with his littlesign offering them to children would beright at home with the rest of them andto top it all off when Funko decided torelease their new circus line of FNAFproducts it contained not just clownversions of all the characters areversions of all of them wearing balloonboys iconic outfit we were being shownthat balloon car and specifically thatoutfit are inherently tied to the circusballoon boy has to be a part of thisFest is where he finally makes senseanother example would be circus babyshe's been showing up a lot in recentgames just like the circus imagery so itfeels like steel Willer purposely tryingto connect the two she's also got thered cheeks we've talked about as well asthat white face paint that we see onmost traditional clowns she'd fit rightin at a circus plus you know she'sliterally got circus in her name maybethis character whose placement in thetimeline has perplexed Tex us for solong belongs way earlier in thefranchise's history than any of usexpected but above those two in thebooks there is one other costume thatgets called out the core four but alwaysone more a jester costume now I'm suremad is once again freaking out becauseJesters aren't clowns and they aren'tpart of a circus and dude I get it butjust trust me on this in that quote fromthe mimic story about the rack ofcostumes after listing off the main fourcharacters we know and love they finishoff by adding and bright pink yellowgreen court jester costumes ilar so thecolors we see Sun wearing in securitybreach yeah I know they're a little offbut they're they're pretty close andjust look at the rest of his costumecurly pointed toes with bells puffytrousers or pants I suppose and the tutulike Frills on his waist and ankles heis 100% meant to be a court jester heeven jumps out of a freaking Castle whenwe first meet him in security breach andas Matt was very keen to point outJesters originated as performers forroyalty in their castles during theMiddle Ages finally there's theepilogues where the jester characteronce again returns but this time we getdescription of its mask quote Luciusstepped up to the costume suppressing ashiver at the Jester's learing toothygrin and its wide eyes one of son's mostdistinct features is his obnoxioustoothy grin it's so iconic that he hadto have teeth underneath his teeth justin case and those large vacant eyesdefinitely give off that learing vibethat Lucia was describing so even thoughsun doesn't have the red cheeks like wetalked about he still appears to be veryobviously connected to the original crewFreddy chica foxy and Bonnie as as wellas the circus here is the last onementioned when they're all being listedoff as if the costumes were groupedtogether like they came from the samecollection of characters characters thatcame from Fazbear's circus days sun andmoon actually make a lot of sense ascharacters in a traveling circus in thetale story Bobby dots we get a bit ofmuch needed backstory on this characterwho just showed up in security breachnot matching any of the 80s tasticdesigns of the pizzza Plex it turns outthey weren't always a daycare attendantbut instead a performer they put onshows where Sun would be the hero andwhen the Lights Went Out Moon wouldappear as the story's villain that tiesinto the comedy and tragedy masks thatwe've found in ruin masks that displaysun and Moon's face so it would havealso been an ideal performance to keepkids entertained at a circus venue andlater on when the daycare was introducedthat same Bobby dot story describes thedayc Care's design as a carnival likespace hammering home the connection tothe character's Origins and then theicing on the cake juring help wanted tohe is the one we face when we're tryingto fix the carousel from those oldfallfest days he's been there since thestart and when you think about it in theearly days of the franchise when you'retrying to keep cost down buying a fullmascot costume or fur suit from atrusted provider can cost upwards of$5,000 while costumes for professionaljesters and clowns are typically just afew hundred bucks keeping costs nice andlow when you're first starting out itreally feels like the circus origin ishelping characters that are out of placehave a place to finally belong sun andmoon baby balloon boy all of them wouldbe right at home here at the circushowever fallfest isn't just just theorigins of the Fazbear franchise it'salso the origins of William aton's firstmajor tragedy Faz blast in help one2 isa shooting gallery that matches thedesign of the Hub World during the curseof dreadbear DLC dreadbear even makes anappearance at the attraction so thisattraction clearly takes place duringfour Fest 1983 however the penultimatefazer Blast Level ends with you shootinga number of rockets and popping all theballoon versions of the animatronicsthat appear doing so seems to cause achain reaction that leads to the WholeThing ending up in flames and when yougo back for the final level the place isburnt to the ground we see the samething happen during the Carousel Ride asyou try to fix it Sparks Fly and thething lights up leading to the nightmareversion of the level where the wholeplace is already Ablaze and if you goout of bounds during that Carousel levelyou can see the Red Sky burnt treesWater Tower and windmill that are allpresent during that final fazer BlastLevel off in the distance steel wool isclearly showing us that much like everyother establishment in this franchisethis event forfest 1983 ended in fire1983 sucked for this franchise butespecially for Afton he loses his kid toa malfunctioning spring lock suit andhis other son's negligence fredbear'sFamily Diner gets shut down and to topit all off he loses the thing thatstarted this whole business the circussteel wool is all about a sympatheticvillain backstory try not to set out tomake a cool looking villain go make amonster they have a reason for it thesearen't just like the supernatural forcesthat came out of nowhere to just hurtpeople and punish people right likethere were results of other wrongdoingadding a fire to an already pretty awfullist of tragedy and loss it would makeit a little less surprising that Aftoncould suddenly snap and go out a murderspree but this fire tells us more thanjust how this first chapter in FNAFhistory ended it also tells us thatthere was one other character heresomeone else present from the beginningthat you wouldn't suspect the mimic yeahI know I was surprised too buteverything seems to be pointing to thisguy being here since the earliest daysof the franchise we get a lot ofdifferent descriptions for the mimicduring the epilogues of tales from thesulex sometimes it's a traditionalendoskeleton other times it's aspider-like mess of slimy black wiresbut when we are first introduced to itwe're given one extra detail a detailthat I never fully understood quote itwasn't just a basic metal structure itssteel frame was contained within abuilding collection of metal rods andcurved plates and an impressive systemof ball joints and pistons all of it wastopped with a long vaguely rectangularshaped shiny steel skull the skull wasthe only part that was shiny the restwas dark and discolored as if it had Sursurvived some kind of fire that's apretty specific way of phrasing itespecially when it points out that thehead isn't blackened by the same issuewe're being given a clue as to wherethis mimic came from because the otherdetail that's important to bear in mindis that quote comes from the very startof the story when the endoskeleton firstarrives at the pizz Plex it wasdelivered to this location already burntwhich tells us that it had to be in aprevious Fazbear fire and I believe thatfire was the fire of f Fest but whatmakes me so sure that the mimic got allburned during that fire specificallyhere's the thing I know we always jokethat everything in this franchise endsin fire but we can actually count thenumber of fires on one hand even ifyou're an animatronic with only fourfingers which means it shouldn't be toodifficult to go through each one anddetermine which one the mimic came fromworking backwards there's a fire at theend of security breach if you beat theburn trap ending Aon is defeated theblob steals him away and the entirepizzza Plex catches fire and collapsesbut as we've talked about before itdoesn't seem like this is the cannonending for security breach we findGregory's drawings for the non-cannonendings during ruin and the last one wecollect is his drawing of the burn trapending which means this fire wasn't areal fire and even if it was this endingtakes place at the pizz Plex so themimic couldn't have been delivered tothe pizzaplex burnt from a fire as theburn trap ending comes later in thetimeline second option is the FF 6 firebut once again we Face issues withtimeline the petplex is being built ontop of the ff6 location which means themimic wouldn't be able to be deliveredto that location when the pizza Plex isbeing constructed like we see in thebook because it would have already beenthere the only other fire left otherthan forfest is the FNAF 3 fire but theowners of Fazbear fright seemed prettystoked when they found their firstworking animatronic springtrap up untilthis point they'd only had bits andpieces like a foxy head so it feels likethey'd have also made a pretty big dealof finding a mimic bringing it back tothe location even if they thought it wasjust an endo so it doesn't feel like itcan be that one either which leaves onlyone fire for the mimik to have beenburnt in the fire of forfest 19 1983meaning the mimic has been around for along time we actually theorized thisback when we covered sun and moon afterthe events of Ruin we connected themimics thrown together thin simpleanimatronic design to that of sun andmoon namely a very weird but distinctfeature independently moving teeth it'sa strange design detail that we've neverseen before so for both characters tohave the same detail in the same gamemakes it seem like they have to beconnected in some way and if sun andmoon come from the early full Festorigins of the franchise then the mimicbeing around at the same time wouldexplain that connection but there's onemore detail that tells me that the mimichas to have been around during theforest era of FNAF something that's beenright under our noses for years for awhile now we' believed that the glitchtrap virus in help wanted one the virusthat takes the shape of a yellow bunnyrabbit and takes over Vanessa's mindisn't actually William Aton himself butinstead a version of the mimic programthat is mimicking aton's behavior in thegame we heard about Fazbear trying tokeep cost down for this new game they'redeveloping I mean they sent us thatstuff in the first place with noexplanation told us to scan it said itwould expedite the process so wewouldn't need to program any pathffinding ourselves it was a budget thingI guess it was just junk circuit boardsand things like that look pretty oldthat game was help wanted it's an inUniverse game that takes the originalFNAF games and turns them into new VRexperiences which is exactly what welearn happened to the mimic program inthe Storyteller quote it's a simpletemplate style software that takespreviously created stories and rearrangechanges them into new scenarios for VRAR and arcade games that is what glitchtrap is the mimic program having beenscanned into the system gets a crashcourse in aton's murdery Tendencies andis now mimicking it hence he appears asafton's iconic yellow Rabbit Exceptthere's one part of this explanationthat never sat right with me if theglitch trap mimic was learning aboutAfton from the in Universe games of FNAF1 to 6 then why does he take this formafon in all of those games even in the 8bit mini games is always wearing hisspring lock suit because that was thecostume he wore at fredbear's FamilyDiner but the version of the suit themimic shows us as glitch trap is acompletely different design and at thetime we'd never seen this version beforethis isn't his spring lock suit it's ahand sewn suit with plastic lookingfacial features similar to the ones wesaw on that concept art those suits camefrom forfest and so it would make sensefor this handsone golden rabbit suit tohave also come from the same time periodbut for the mimic to have been able tocopy this design it would have to havesome memory of this version of afon inits memory banks prior to being uploadedto The Help Wanted game system it wouldhave to have observed Aton perform inthis iconic golden rabbit costumealongside a golden singing bear atfallfest the mimic would have to bearound during the early costume days ofthe franchise tape girl did say thecircuit boards looked pretty old afterall it was just junk circuit boards andthings like that look pretty old maybethe mimic was originally meant to mimicafon specifically I'm not entirely sureof this to be honest but it does feellike this is where the clues might beheaded both for W Fest and the dino wereopen until 1983 after all so theycoexisted for at least 4 years with thedino opening in 1979 and we know thatAton was performing as spring Bonny atthe diner so it's possible that themimic was part of aton's plan to expandthe business he could literally be intwo places at once eventually the mimicwould be locked underground with somecircuit boards containing itsprogramming set aside just in case andwhen the mimic software was finally usedagain to help speed up the process of anew VR game it was shown all of thoseold FNAF games and while it watched andlearned it recognized someone WilliamAfton the golden rabbit from the circusand so decided to take on the form itremembered from all those years agocreating the monster we have spent thelast three games and two DLCs trying tostop but hey that's just a theory a gametheory thanks for watchingsniffing out Minecraft's weirdest mobspassive overwhelm mobs tend to be basedon real life animals wolves cats parrotsyou name it but then what is the sniffersupposed to be it's slow moving has abeak like snout has fur like a mammalbut then it lays eggs it can't possiblybe a real thing right wrong the snifferis an ancient mob so let me introduceyou to a group of prehistoric creaturescalled dadants these were herbivoresthat existed during the perm and aTriassic periods they were slow movingwith barrel-shaped B small ornon-existent tails hoofless beaks andcould vary in size from less than ameter tall to the size of elephant it'snot confirmed whether they had fur likethe sniffer but they were an offshoot ofother therapsids that would evolve intomodern mammals and given their legjoints and skull features diodon areconsidered more mammal than lizard andso it's likely they did have fur theyalso likely laid eggs given their closemammal-like relatives also laid eggs atthe time this doesn't explain the sixlegs but if you'd like an answer forthat particular mystery you'll need tocheck out our video on the sniffers lawregardless I think we can all agreethey're still pretty cute don't you justwant to scratch andWhat is the sniffer?This fascinating creature
looks vastly different thanany other creature we've ever seen on this earthOnce thought an extinct creature the sniffer's
eggs were excavated from a warm ocean ruinAllowing us to enjoy these
ancient creatures today. Wait,did you say ancient? Oh buddy.
You know what that meansHello Internet, welcome to game theory the showThat's always sniffing for clues and digging uplaw and you guys have no idea how
happy I am to be doing this episodeI've written a number of minecraft theories in my
time. But this one is my minecraft Ian white whaleI was so excited when the trails and
tails update came out almost a year agoFinally an update that was going to focus on theancient law of Minecraft and what did
Mojang give us some lines on our armor?And pieces of broken pots. Yeah,
it wasn't the most exciting updateIt was certainly no warden that's for sureBut we made the most of it and
we managed to use those brokenpots and armor trims to figure
out the ancient builders weren'tOne collective group but a number of tribes
each with their own specific resourcesHowever, there is one part of this update
that we've purposefully ignored oneI'm sure the keen miners and crafters among
you have already noticed the winner of themob vote of 2022 the snifferWinnerThis is a mob that apparently went extinctBut if you find an egg you can hatch it and fromthat point on it will spend its time
walking around sniffing for specialSeeds that it'll then dig upIt's a pretty unique mechanic
plus the idea of finding an eggrather than taming a wild mob
is a fun idea and in the pastWhenever a new mob has been added we've made sure
to do a video covering it as soon as possibleSo why after almost a year is there
no video on this adorable thick boy?Well, because despite me trying
over and over and over againI couldn't figure out where it fits into the law
that we've been building for the past four yearsI knew it had to fit in somewhere because Mojangwere really keen on using one
specific word during its revealThis can hatch this ancient mob and
help it thrive. We also believe ithas ancient knowledge to show look at themThey're practically mocking me
but no more because after almosta year of driving myself insane much
like a snifflet hatching from an eggI finally cracked it. I figured out what theancient mysteries this dump
truck of a mob is hidingSo grab your excavation brushes friends. It's timeto uncover the lost history
of the Minecraft snifferLet's start with finding these dang thingsThe only way to get your hands on a sniffer is to
find one of their eggs buried in suspicious sandsspecifically suspicious sand that you find
in warm ocean ruins these ruins belong to theFisherman tribe of ancient builders
as shown by the angular pottery showthat you can also find in the
suspicious sand of these ruinsWe've discussed these guys many
times before on this channelThey would go on to cause the sea levels
to rise eventually flooding their tribeand leaving nothing behind but
ocean monuments and these smallRuins, but there are actually two
other sherds that you can findfrom this tribe of fishermen
and one of them is especiallyInteresting for our purposes today.
It's called the snort sherd and on itWe find a familiar creature
the sniffer this proves thatMojang calling this thing an ancient mob wasAbsolutely on purpose because the
existence of this shirt tells usthat the sniffer was alive at the
same time as the ancient builderFisherman tribe as they were the ones
who carved these images into the potsBut of course this episode isn't
just about proving they coexisted.We need to figure out why they coexisted sniffersAren't exactly known for catching fish. So what
use would they have been to a tribe of fishermen?Well, it turns out there are a couple of reasonsThe first one is simple as I mentioned earlierThe sniffers main mechanic is
to well sniff by sniffing theyfind things buried in the ground
and they can dig them up kind ofLike truffle pigs, but instead
of a tasty topping for your chipsSorry friesSniffer instead digs up special seeds torch
flower seeds and pitcher plant seeds these flowersHonestly don't serve much purpose. They can be
used to make dyes and they make nice decorationBut they aren't particularly useful,
especially given how hard they are to getHowever, there is one more use for the
torch flower specifically something thatwould be useful for the fisherman
tribe by mixing torch flower intoA suspicious stew recipe you create a stew thatgives you the night vision effect
night vision is especially usefulIf you're wanting to explore ocean
monuments and as the water levelsbegin to rise for the warm ocean and
the neighboring cold ocean tribesthis would become a must-have
ability that cold ocean tribea tribe of pirates would eventually be
sent out to find the ingredients for aConduit an item that would also give the tribes
night vision as well as underwater breathingBut in the meantime the suspicious stew would
take care of at least one of those issuesWhat do we find on the sunken ships that belong tothat tribe of pirates? That's
right suspicious stew thoughThat isn't the only thing we can
learn from these special plantsI mean it'd be a bit weird for Mojang to introducetwo new plants and for only one
of them to be actually usefulI felt kind of bad for the pitcher
plant. So in classic Minecraft fashionI kept digging and in doing so I struck
gold or diamonds or is it netherite?But just like the mobs in the game a
lot of the plants from the overworldtend to be related to real-world plants like rosesSunflowers tulips you get the ideaSo I took a look at what the real-worldCounterparts are for the torch
flower and the pitcher plant thepitcher plant is easy enough because
it's just a plant that exists thoughThere are many varieties torch flowers on the
other hand don't exist at least not by that nameThey resemble the Nephothia genus commonly knownas the red hot poker or torch plant. I
mean, come on. It's not rocket scienceI think we can pretty much call that one confirmedBoth plants are native to the tropical and
southern parts of the African continentwith torch plants mostly being in
the mountainous south and varietiesOf pitcher plants being found in both Madagascarand the Seychelles and this actually
lines up with what we see in MinecraftThere's one more warm ocean pottery shirt that weare yet to talk about and
this one is called shelterIt depicts an acacia tree a type of tree that
grows in the savannah biomes of the overworldBut they also grow in tropical regions like
Africa meaning that before they eventuallyFlooded the fisherman tribe lived in a savannah
style bio near an ocean to allow for fishingbut also tropical enough in climate to allow thetorch flower pitcher plants and acacia
trees to grow and opening the door to theAfrican inspirations also revealed
another important detail about theseplants while they may not actually
give you night vision in real life inIndigenous cultures they were used as medicineThe pitcher plant was used to help with things
like constipation urinary tract infectionseven diabetes while the torch flower has been usedto treat malaria hepatitis B eczema female
infertility and a bunch more these types ofMedicinal plants were used
specifically by traditionalhealers known as in younger
and people would travel fourMiles just for a chance to
receive medical care from them,which means the warm ocean tribe
wasn't just a tribe of fishermenThey were also a tribe of in younger and sowould use the sniffer to find the
seeds for these medicinal plantsThey then use them as a source of
night vision in their suspiciousstews for their explorers or to
heal any ancient build that neededHelp with their recent zombie bites. This is whythe sniffers are depicted on their
pottery shirts much like fishingThey were a cornerstone of their society
and that's why all these years laterWe can find their eggs buried in the
ruins of the cities. They used to helpHowever, while this is where the sniffers ended upIt isn't actually where they started and
if you think these guys are big now, wellBuddy, do I have a surprise for you?If you go underground in the overworld you have achance of finding generated
structures known as fossilsThey've been in the game since version 1.10Which was released all the way back
in 2016 and yet we've never been ableto figure out what kind of creatures they relateTo the game files label these fossils as either
fossil skull number 1 to 4 or fossil spineAlso number 1 to 4 these fossils
are skeletons of dead creaturesfrom a long forgotten time an
ancient time if you will and atThis point you can probably see where I'm going
with this by using spine 4 and skull 3 togetherIt looks like the skeleton of a massive sniffer
with big nostrils and a large barrel body nowI know what you're thinking.
The sniffer is pretty big,but it's not that big. Whatever.
These skeletons are they wereMassive beasts larger than the biggest
mob in the game the ender dragon. However,I do have an explanation for thisdomestication and natural selectionDomestication is the process of
taming an animal to keep as a petor to use for work tasks like farming dogs wereDomesticated from a species of wolf known as
the gray wolf from around a hundred and thirtyThousand years ago with time the wolves became
more obedient more docile and yes smallerThis is because the smaller the creature easierit is to control and the less likely it
is to overpower you and so humans wouldSpecifically breed the smaller ones
in order to pass down that traitThis is likely what happened to
the sniffer smaller ones weretamed and chosen to breed because let's be honestIt's gonna be pretty hard to keep
control of a beast whose body aloneis five meters tall for referenceThat's the total height of a giraffe you make oneof these things angry and it's
gonna stomp you out of existenceNow natural selection and
domestication takes a longtime to get the size difference between the
sniffer fossil and the sniffer we have todayIt would have taken thousands upon
thousands of years and that's somethingwe haven't actually talked about
when covering the ancient buildersNormally for the sake of keeping these Minecrafttheories clear and concise. We tend to
put all the events in quick successionWe go from the ancient builders going back
in time to saving the world to doomingthe world to dying out all within 25 minutesBut what we've never talked about is how
long each of those eras took for this exampleThe fisherman tribe created a
bunch of greenhouse gases thatcaused the water levels to rise
and eventually they all drownedIt sounds like it happened very quicklyBut giant monuments aren't suddenly
submerged overnight from 1880 to 2022sea levels have only risen 8 to 9 inches or about20 to 23 centimeters in a hundred and forty years
the water hasn't risen enough to drown a cityHowever, given enough time it very well couldcurrent predictions are that in the next 2,000
years sea levels are likely to rise between 2To 3 meters or 6 and a half to
10 feet if temperatures go upby the expected 1.5 degrees Celsius or 2.7 degreesFahrenheit that is definitely going
to put some of our cities underwaterBut an ocean monument is 28 meters
tall for those to be underwaterIt would mean temperatures rising
by about 5 degrees Celsius or9 degrees Fahrenheit. And
even then it would still take10,000 years based on most predictions
and that would be the perfect amount oftime for the ancient builders
to breed the sniffers to beSmaller and more manageable like
we see today. There's just oneteeny tiny flaw in this otherwise perfect solutionYou can't find these particular fossils in thewarm ocean biomes. You find
them in the deserts so farEverything has been connecting
them to the warm ocean tribeSo why would their giant skeletons
be found in a different biome?Well as it usually does it comes back
to the troublemakers of the ancientbuilder world the desert tribe
the scientists who dared to pushThe boundaries of the world they lived
in warm oceans are typically found nextto deserts due to them sharing
the same climate making theseTribes neighbors likely sharing
resources and technology whichwould come in handy when the desert tribe beganexperimenting with potions that could
help them breathe underwater the deserttribe were also the ones who eventually
crossed over into the nether trying toFind a solution for the rising
oceans that their neighbors hadcaused and this is where I believe
the final piece of the sniffer puzzleFalls into place take a look
at the sniffer again noticeits colors animals typically
adapt to their environmentAnd one way this happens is by changing the colorof their skin or fur to better
blend in with their surroundingsThis again happens through natural selection theanimals that blend in are
much more likely to surviveAllowing them to mate and
pass on those colorful genesBut the sniffer's colors don't blend in withany overworld biome the red and
teal stick out like a sore thumbAgainst the various greens blues and yellows,but you know what they do blend
in with the colors of the netherSpecifically the red netherrack and teal warpednileum of the warped forest biome and
this is where I believe the snifferOriginally came from nileum is
the nether's version of myceliumand mycelium is a mass of branched
wires that connect fungi togetherSo nileum is a fungus or at
least part of one which wouldexplain why the sniffer's back is
a different color from its bodyWe see this kind of thing happen with animals likesloths whose fur changes color
due to the algae growing in itWhich just so happens to work as the perfect?Camouflage the sniffer evolved its red
fur to blend in with the netherrack ofthe nether and then while living
in the warped forests the warpedNileum fungus spread and attached itself
to the sniffer's fur helping it blendin even more the nether might
also explain the whole six legsThing most overworld passive mobs
are based on real-world animals,but there are no mammals with six legsIt's just not how they're built. However mobs
in the never like to break this rule of realismWe've got walking pigs giant ghosts and passive
mobs like the strider and just look at themThey are far from normal a creature with
six legs would feel right at home hereBut the final nail in the sniffer's giantcoffin comes back to the fossils. They
don't just generate in the overworldThey also generate in the
nether's soul sand valleysThese fossils are specifically of different
parts of the body rather than spines and skullsWe have rib cages of varying sizes
which could relate back to our giantsniffer after all animals of the same speciesOften come in a variety of sizes, but there
is one fossil that is different fossilTo is labeled as a horizontal sternumThe sternum is a t-shaped flat bone that in
mammals sits at the front of the rib cageAnd it is the missing piece of our puzzlewhen you place this sternum into the
spine for that we found in the overworldThe spine and rib cage of
the sniffer it fits perfectlyThese are the bones of the same creature meaning
the sniffer had to at some point be in the netherSo if the nether is their rightful home
based on their color physiology and fossilsWhy aren't there any seeds for them to dig up?The sniffer's only function is to dig
for torch flower and pitcher plant seedsBut if you take a sniffer back to the
nether, they won't dig up anythingEven if you place down more grass
blocks these seeds don't exist hereor maybe it's that they don't exist here anymoreIn another theory we proved that the
nether was not always the fiery landscapeIt is now the existence of
the basalt deltas showed usthat there was once an ice age
as you need ice and soul soilFor basalt to be created. This means
water had to exist in the netherSo more traditional plants like torch flowers and
pitcher plants could definitely have grown hereWe've also spoken about the
biodiversity in the netherand how in the past there used to be
many more species of flora and faunaLike torch flowers and pitcher plants, but both
the ice age and the biodiversity came to an endThanks to the piglins heating up the atmosphere byindustrializing creating weapons
and armor to conquer more worldsSo we have evidence that these giant
sniffers existed in the soul sand valleysAnd so it would make sense that at
one point in time these seeds andflowers used to exist in this part of the netherBut when the valleys dried up there were no moreseeds for the sniffers to eat causing
them to starve and die out with theirfossils being all that remained the ones that
did survive would need to find a new biome aBiome with plant life that
they might be able to liveoff the forests of the nether due to their red furThey would blend in really
well with the crimson forestHowever, the crimson forest is
home to hoglins and piglins bothhostile mobs with the latter being
specifically known for huntingNow, of course, these are giant sniffersso you might think that piglins
and hoglins aren't gonna be muchof a threat but Neanderthals used to hunt
massive creatures like woolly mammoths andThey would often target the much
smaller offspring as they would bemuch easier to hunt or kill and that could lead toExtinction which is why they ended
up inhabiting the warped forestThe warped forest is home to the striders a
passive mob that was no threat to the sniffletsPlus mobs like the hoglin
are afraid of warped fungusrunning away when within seven blocks of the stuffIt was the perfect place to hide and over time the
warped Nilean began to grow on their backs furtherBlending them into the forest, but as
we know their journey isn't over yetEventually the desert tribe entered the netherDiscovering the magical properties that the mobsof this world could provide
them things like blaze rodsMagma balls and gas tears and so they wantedto see what the sniffer was
capable of despite its sizeThe sniffer was a docile creature. And so they
were able to lure it back to the overworldThey began selectively breeding
them to make them more manageableBut during that time they noticed
the sniffers were clearly lookingfor something and when they wandered
a little further two patches of grassThey dug up seeds that no one had
seen before grass was a rare sightin the desert and the sniffers can't dig up sandBlocks, however, there was plenty of grass in
the neighboring Savannah like warm ocean biomeSo the desert tribe gave the
sniffers to their neighborsthe fishermen to allow the sniffers to
find more seeds and maybe find a useFor them they live close to
the water and have the rightconditions for these plants to grow
and when they did the fishermen beganTo experiment with them learning of their
medicinal and night vision propertiesAllowing them to create stews that would aid themin their efforts to see deep into
the water as they fish or createMedicines to heal their wounds the tribebecame more than just fishermen.
They were now a tribe of healersSadly thoughThese advances didn't stop the rising
tides and while the fishermen andhealers would eventually turn into the
drowned that we know today with theirKnowledge of the plants healing properties lostto time the sniffers weren't so lucky.
They didn't transform into something elseThey just drowned leaving just a few eggs buried
in the sand for us to find many years laterSo if you do find a sniffer be
kind to it because now, you knowAll the pain and suffering
its ancestors went throughjust so you could have a nice-looking house plantAnd with that I'm gonna call this white whaleOfficially conquered but hey

a game theory. Thanks for watchingphone guy is back that's right ladiesand gentlemen we are getting a brand newFNAF book only this time it's aninteractive story called the week beforeit takes place well the week before thevery first SNF game and we are taking onthe role of a security guard trying tosurvive but we already know who theoriginal security guard was before MikeSchmidt the infamously Forgotten phoneguy I actually worked in that officebefore you I'm finishing up my last weeknow as a matter of fact see you on theflip side however when the FNAF moviecame out we actually got some moreinsight into who phone guy actually washe wasn't just a random security guardhe was William Affton himself I willcatch you on the flipside hopefullymeaning we might finally be gettingsomething that shows us aton'sperspective how he felt what his motiveswere we know he had a reason to be atthe FNAF 1 Pizzeria he wanted to collectRemnant from the animatronics but thetimeline of events is still a mysteryalthough this book does have 25 endingso good luck trying to figure out whichone is the cannon one oh I shouldprobably call Matt about this uh let mejust grab myHello Internet!Welcome to Game Theory, the show that always welcomes you home like a good neighbor should.And if you wanna be the best neighbor, you can go ahead and click that subscribe button.That way, you will see as we do, neighbor.If you couldn't tell from the bad wordplay and weird glitches, today we are revisitinga franchise that I have been so excited to jump into ever since I became host of thechannel.The creative and artistic horror experience, Welcome Home.I have been hooked on the way that this website tells its story, with spelling errors, drawingsand literal bugs revealing to us the strange and wonderful world of this long forgotten70s edutainment show, and a group known as the Welcome Home Restoration Project thatis trying desperately to revive it.But in classic ARG fashion, there are dark secrets beneath the surface.Spooky audio messages, hidden pages and disturbing videos all showing us that this charming neighbourhoodmight not be so charming after all.In fact, it's way more than just a kids show.It's a cult.A cult that worships an all-powerful entity that lives in the centre of their town, thesentient house known simply as Home, and led by its faithful servant and Mr. Rogers stand-in,Wally.In our last couple of theories, we've established that Wally has somehow managed to make contactwith the real world.This is all in order to indoctrinate the WHRP, and eventually, the world, through the exhibitionsthat were being put on.However, it became clear that Wally might not actually be doing this willingly.Which I guess makes sense.No one could be evil and wear stylish, soft-boy cardigans like that.I should get me one of those.Amy!Can we make one of those?Only if you prove that people want to buy it!You know what to do, guys.Get down in those comments!Anyway, where was I?Oh yeah, Wally. It turns out that Home has been controlling Wally this whole time, but now, he's tryingto fight back.And he's not the only one.There's someone else from the neighborhood that's been using the bugs on the websiteto expose Home's plan.The local bug enthusiast and resident grump, Frank Frankly.But now, after all this time, the internet darling, Wally Darling, is back.And he's got a shiny new website in celebration of Homewarming.Which is Welcome Home's version of Christmas.In March.So as you can tell, things are already not adding up.Which means there's likely going to be a bunch of brand new lore waiting for us inthe neighborhood.So, even though it's spring, wrap up warm, get a hot cup of cocoa and join me, neighbor,as we uncover the secrets behind this new website and spread the holiday cheer for allto hear.For all to hear.For.All.To.HEAR.First of all, when I say shiny new website, I really do mean it.This isn't just an update.The old website has been taken down and a new one has been rebuilt in its place in orderto get rid of all those pesky bugs, glitches and files.There are these weird new doodles around the website, but I clicked on them and nothinghappened so it seems like this reboot was a success.Other than that, the website seems relatively similar to the old one, outside of the newChristmassy themes.But if you take a look at the news section, there's a newsletter that tells us all aboutthe new stuff they have over on the merchandise page.So I guess that's where we're going next.And they really weren't lying.This is by far the biggest part of the update.There are audio files from Welcome Home commercials, songs sung by members of the neighborhoodincluding Wally's tone deaf rendition of the song Toyland by Doris Day.There's even children's toys that contain actual throwing knives and an unsettling cookbookfull of disturbing recipes that I am definitely going to be sending over to Santi later.But there was one new addition that stood out to me above all the rest.Yes, even those deadly weapons.And that was the Crispy Sweets Frosted Cereal Box.More specifically, the back of the cereal box.We see our reliable mailman Eddie Dear holding a decoder ring, encouraging us to make orbreak secret codes.Call it a hunch, I think that might be a clue.This decoder ring uses pictures that correlate with the letters of the alphabet.And if you've been paying attention, these pictures are the exact same as the ones we'vebeen seeing scattered around the website.Ha!I knew those random doodles weren't just random doodles.So of course, I scoured every page and found every last one of them.Now all we have to do is figure out what this jumble of letters is supposed to say.I managed to find the words "Away From Prying Eyes", but I was left with a handful of lettersthat at first I just couldn't figure out.That was until I remembered that this is a web-based ARG.These letters aren't words, they're part of a URL.Three W's at the start, and the T and E spelling out the domain, dot net, giving usthe website www.awayfrompryingeyes.net.And sure enough, type that into your search bar and we're taken to a brand new website.This site contains the writings from a member of the WHRP, gathering evidence of all theweird glitches from the old website, trying to figure out what's going on.Looking down the page, we can see that the writer is named W, which feels suspiciousgiven the only character we know with W as the first letter of their name is Wally.However, we don't really get anything more to go on, so I'm just gonna leave that befor now.But make no mistake, I'm watching you.Regardless, I started reading what W had to say, and as I did, it occurred to me thatwe've actually met this character before.In this post, W notes his frustration, quote, no one has come forward or provided leads,and dead ends have since piled up.Which lines up with a quote from a newsletter that was posted during a minor update backin October, the Halloween update, where again, the writer is very vocal about the lack ofinformation.Our source has yet to send the full book, I don't understand why, what is it worthto leave it out?Ripping out pages, what a waste.It takes so long to get everything off of them.Still, we're patient, aren't we?If you're reading this, please hurry.So it would appear that W is the one writing the newsletters, but those aren't the onlywritings of theirs that we've seen before.Remember on the original website where we found text that said things like, when I unwrappedthe first letter I felt it, I heard it, open, open, open.I want it out.I'm going to get it out.Well, the same kind of writing style can be seen from W on this new hidden website.It needed me.I needed it.Everyone started to look at us.You want this as badly as I do.Up until now, we've suspected that these hidden entries on the old website were writtenby the Question Answerer, the museum curator that was hired to put on the Playfellow exhibition.They created their own hidden website that would tell us about a dream they had withWally sat at the foot of their bed, calling them on a toy telephone.He was the only one acting erratically, so at the time, it made sense that he would bethe one making these chaotic entries.But now, W's writing seems to be a much stronger match.Plus, it would make way more sense for a member of the WHRP to be able to alter the main websiterather than a freelance museum curator.W even references the question answerer and the events that we saw in the last update.Nothing from our curator who has since recovered.I don't know what happened to them to become so unwell, to create that page.Things clearly got a lot worse for our curator friend between updates.But despite knowing about the website and what it said about the telephone, W decidedto grab the defective toy anyway and continue trying to fix it after the exhibition.We can see a page labelled "Broken Phone" that contains their findings, and we learn thatno matter what W tries, the phone is still doing the same thing it was for the Question AnswererIt won't stop ringing.When they pick it up, it doesn't give them an answer either.Until it does.What we hear is Wally's terrible cover of the song Toyland.Only this time, there are lines from Wally talking at the beginning and the end.Wally is still using the phone to communicate to whoever is on the other end, but unlikelast time with the Question nswerer, I don't think this is the side of Wally controlledby Home.Listen to what Wally says before hanging up.That line, I don't want to end this call, to me, sounds like desperation.Wally says that he's alone with Home, and he doesn't sound excited, because with noone else around, Home can take control and carry out the next part of his plan.Homewarming is the next part of Home's scheme to keep the neighborhood in line andindoctrinate more people into this cult.And we can see this plan in action if we head on over to the second piece of evidence fromthis new secret site named "Commercials".On this page, W tells us that they managed to somehow find snippets of the actual WelcomeHome TV show playing on their old TV.Previous entries on the old website talked about how no one seems to remember this showand despite having a bunch of merch, they had no evidence the actual TV show existed.So this is a huge deal, at least it would be if W had actually managed to record any of it.Dude, you had one job.Though I shouldn't give them too hard a time, they seem to recognise their mistakeand so from this point onwards, they leave the TV on, constantly watching, hoping theshow would return to the screen.Until finally, he found something.Quote,I was finally rewarded in December.The channel it appeared on didn't make any sense, but I didn't care.Video evidence and audio started playing, one after the other.I've captured and compiled together whatever I could.When footage would disappear, I would have to move to another channel, where anotherwould appear, and then disappear again.This explains why a Christmas-themed update seems to be happening in March.The newsletter that told us about the new merchandise is actually labelled December25th, Christmas Day.But immediately after that, a new newsletter is released calling it a mistake.This update was planned for December, but they were so engrossed with these commercials,so determined to record evidence, that they lost track of time and ended up staring atthis TV for months.To the point they even claim that things in their house have started rotting.But it was worth it, because now, after a year of the website talking about a show thatdidn't seem to exist, W finally had video evidence of Welcome Home, and what has beenuncovered is harrowing.This video is mostly filled with commercials, advertising things like cereals, sleepingpills and cigarettes.Ah yes, a balanced breakfast for any child growing up in the 70s.I'm making a joke about it, but back then, advertising this sort of thing with animatedcharacters was pretty normal.However, morally questionable adverts aren't the only thing this video includes.W laments that the original show they saw never reappeared again, except for a coupleof clips from the perspective of a character we've not actually spent a lot of time with.Compared to the likes of Wally, Frank or Barnaby, he felt like a bit of a background character.But now, he seems to be taking centre stage, showing us that decoder ring that got us startedon this whole journey.I'm talking about Welcome Home's reliable mailman, Eddie Dear.In these clips, we see Eddie wondering why no one asked him to deliver anything and so,to pass the time, he starts wrapping presents for his friends, but constantly begins todoubt his choices.If no one is trusting him with the mail, are his choices even good enough?All of this eventually leads to frustration.He slams the desk and throws things around because he feels useless and alone.Poor guy, just give the man something to deliver, it's all he has!But, these clips highlight something that has been bubbling away under the surface ofWelcome Home pretty much since the beginning.Eddie is an outcast.In our last theory, we showed that the interactions between the neighbors are not as harmoniousas they seem, but looking more closely, you realize that out of all of them, Eddie isthe one that is most often mistreated, insulted or taken advantage of.When Eddie is talking to Howdy about what he's doing that day, Howdy just waves him off.Barnaby chases him down the street, demanding his delivery.And in a secret video from the Halloween update, Sally is talking about a famous performer.Eddie recalls that same performer and Sally saysEven the mailman gets it, as if he's somehow lesser.Clearly, the town thinks very little of Eddie.But there's something else that stood out to me.Why is there no mail?It's the holiday season, surely there's something for Eddie to deliver.Even when the neighbors are being mean to him in those previous videos, he's stillgoing around delivering mail.Hence Barnaby is even able to chase him down the street.So where has all the mail gone?Well, do you guys remember the guestbook from the original Welcome Home website?The one that had all those reaction drawings from Wally that helped us figure out he wastalking to us?And do you remember what greeted us before we entered that guestbook?A colorful envelope, a pixel art version of Eddie Dear, and an image telling you tovisit the guestbook, next to another image of Eddie.Eddie is associated with the guestbook, almost as if he's responsible for delivering thosemessages.But what you might also remember is that back in July, the guestbook was closed in orderto stop Wally from interacting with us.Quote, I'm closing the guestbook, I'm not playing this game anymore, the ringingis enough.You could still see the guestbook, but you were no longer able to submit new entries.There were no new messages to pass on, no new letters to deliver.And that's why, come home warming, Eddie has run out of stuff to deliver.Because the well of fan interactions has dried up.Meaning he's out of a job, and now he's starting to crack.And that is exactly what Home wants.This video continues with the residents all heading to home for the Homewarming party.Eddie sits in an armchair and the narrator says,Eddie Dear was happy.But as the line is repeated, Eddie's face begins to sweat.He looks concerned.And the audio begins to build until suddenly, there's silence.Eddie looks at his plate.A plate that holds a single pea.That's pretty weird.But this "meal" is featured on the last page of the Welcome Home cookbookas a certified showstopper.And at the bottom of the recipe is a note.Having a get together?Consider inviting more peas to the party.Add additional peas according to how many guests there are.Take care not to place them too close together.The peas aren't just peas, they are representations of the neighbors from Home.Just like the pegs were in the last update.And it's telling us to have them all separated rather than together.Up until now, we believed that Home wasn't happy about the neighbors constantly fightingeach other.But the more I look at this pea on a plate, the more I wonder if that's actually whatHome wants.Home doesn't want any of them too friendly or close.Why?Because it offers them the perfect opportunity for control.In this video, Eddie looks up to find himself alone in a black void, with Home staring rightback at him.A scene that looks awfully familiar to the one we found underneath Home on the old website.A black void with Wally worshipping Home as Home's eye is staring at him.What follows are the sounds of Eddie struggling, his heartbeat racing, he clutches the armsof the chair, his vision begins to blur, until we are snapped back into the party with Frankand Sally talking to Eddie.Exactly like what happens to Wally during the Halloween update.We've known for a while that Wally is under the control of Home, and so this new videois showing us that he isn't the only one.Eddie has also fallen into Home's grasp.Earlier in this video we even played a clip that shows Wally feeling isolated and alone.That is Home's tactic.Get the neighbors alone, disenfranchise them with the neighborhood, and take control.We see the idea repeated in Wally's rendition of Toyland.While Eddie was living in the neighborhood, just dwelling, he was happy.But the moment he saw the neighborhood wasn't all it was cracked up to be, passing itsborders, he's gone too far, he can't go back to pretending everything is fine.Eddie feels like he's not wanted in the neighborhood, he's becoming separated fromthe group, so much so that he is the only one to not have any home warming decorationson his post office.And thanks to the lack of mail from the guestbook, he's become isolated, lacking purpose, makinghim the perfect puppet.And remember, the only reason he has no mail is because Wally, Home's first puppet, wasresponding to the guestbook, which forced W to shut it down.Home has been playing 4D chess this whole time, and we had no idea.Home is using W to take control of the neighbourhood, the WHRP, and the world.Eddie being under Home's control also explains why W hasn't received any updates sinceChristmas.The WHRP always said,All the information found on this website was extracted from documents that had beenuncovered in brightly colored envelopes.Colored envelopes have always been associated with Eddie.He delivers all mail to and from Home in these colorful envelopes, which means he was alwayshelping Wally to send these letters from the start.But now, Eddie isn't collecting or sending mail anymore.He's working for Home.But hope is not lost.Frank Frankly is seen at the end of this video talking to Eddie.But when Eddie isn't responding, Frank becomes more concerned.He stops addressing Eddie as Mr. Dear, and starts whispering his first name.As we discussed last time, Frank is the man on the inside.He was the one we found on the Question Answerer's secret website in a picture that showed himwith human hands surrounded by his own body parts.He is using these to disguise himself and uncover the cult at the center of the neighborhood.Now he's using the bugs and secret videos to help us realise that horrible truth.As Eddie can barely get a word out during this encounter, it seems like Frank is awareof what's happening to him.He's becoming another puppet for Home's game, and so he's trying to help him breakaway.Each time Frank says Eddie's name, Eddie's vision becomes clearer.Kind of like how in the secret videos we found by clicking Frank's bugs, we see Wally'svision begin to glitch out when his name is mentioned.These videos are from Frank, so he knows that saying their names, expressing concern andbuilding those connections, it can disconnect them from Home.But he does it in whispers so the rest of the neighbours, and especially Wally, can'thear him.Again, the other neighbors don't know that Frank isn't who he says he is.So he's being secretive in what he's doing while trying to help Eddie out best he can.As we've discussed, W hasn't received any new mail since Christmas, which meansthis fix is likely only temporary.And with 2 out of 8 members of the neighborhood under Home's control, it's only a matterof time before the rest of the town succumb to Home's plan.And if Home has their way, we'll all be joining them down in the void very soon.But hey, that's just a theory.A GAME THEORY.Thanks for watching.And if you like ARG puzzles but you don't really want to spend hours going through themon your own, why not click the video on the left and join Matt as he takes a look

update that went relativelyunder the radar in it we found a videoof Sally Starlet talking about a monsterthat roams the neighborhood and eatsanyone who stays up past their bedtime Imean it's Halloween a spooky monsterstory isn't that weird until you findthe secret Link in the transcript byfollowing the link we get a video fromW's point of view in it Eddie says waitis that supposed to be an insult and atthat point W's Vision darkens the audiodistorts and the Apple that was on thetable suddenly has a bite taken out ofit the monster Sally mentioned is realand it's Wally for a while now we'vesuspected that Wally is under thecontrol of home the sentient house thatruns the neighborhood we've even seenhome begin to take control of Wally whenthe neighbors argue in the past but Inever would have guessed thatIf there's one thing we all know about Fortnite, it's that they love their character crossover events.Usually, we get typically strong, muscular heroes like Goku, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, or John Wick.But I think we can all agree we were a little surprised when we saw this.Buff Peter Griffin.What was even more surprising was his method on achieving this physique.A single jar of Slurp Juice, one of Fortnite's most iconic items.But the craziest part of all of this?The science might actually be possible.Hello, Internet.Welcome to Game Theory, the show that slurps down video games in the name of science.That's right, folks.After almost three years, Game Theory is hopping off that battle bus and dropping back into the world of Fortnite.And what, dear theorists, has forced me to return to this massive series after so long?Was it the ever-growing and convoluted lore?Was it the seemingly infinite list of microtransactions?No, it was that in Chapter 5, Season 1, they added Peter freaking Griffin.And this, Peter, is putting the cut in cutaway gags.Now, this isn't without explanation.In the video announcing his addition to the game, we see Peter at the doctor's office getting a physical from Fortnite's resident swellcat, Meowsicles.Meowsicles?How is that word pronounced?Oh, no.Getting a physical from Fortnite's resident swellcat, Meowsles.Peter makes it quite clear that he's trying to get jacked, but he's not actually willing to put in any work.So instead, Meowsles decides to give Peter a jar of something, and boom, instant muscles.What was in that jar that helped Peter go from family guy to fitness bro?None other than Fortnite's iconic Slurp Juice.This slurpy goodness was a consumable item in Fortnite that used to heal quite a bit of health back in the day.It was created by Slurp Co. in the aptly named Slurpy Swamp.Over the years, Slurp Juice has been added and removed and added again, but it still remains one of Fortnite's most iconic and beloved items.But the only thing I could think of when I saw Peter down that juice is, could something like this actually exist?I mean, Slurp Juice seems to pack a pretty powerful punch.Not only does it heal all wounds, but it also could turn Peter Griffin into Dwayne The Rock Johnson.Could a juice help heal you and grow your muscles without you having to lift a finger?The answer, as it turns out, is an unequivocal yes.After hours of research, I think I may have discovered the secret ingredient that makes Slurp Juice so slurpy.And it's something that you might find in your local pharmacy sooner than you'd think.Grab your mason jars and juice presses, loyal theorists.It's time to squeeze every bit of science out of this six-year-old item.To kickstart our slurpy investigation, I, of course, turned to the game itself.Does it give us any indication of what Slurp Juice might be?It does, but not in the Battle Royale.Instead, the answer actually comes from the newest addition to the Fortnite family, Lego Fortnite.Lego Fortnite is an open-world survival crafting game that converts everything into the lovable Lego brick style.Huh, wonder how Mojang feels about that.Anyway, because of that crafting, Lego Fortnite allows you to take raw ingredients and turn them into consumable items,including Slurp Juice, which only requires two simple ingredients.Raspberries and Slurp Mushrooms.There you have it. Theory over. We figured out what Slurp Juice is.But obviously, we're not done.Because while we have the ingredients, we need to see whether they would actually achieve what the game suggests.So it's time for some good old-fashioned food science.For starters, raspberries are-Uh, what do you think you're doing?Oh, it's Santy.What does it look like I'm doing? I'm about to explain the science of a video game item.What it looks like you're doing is trying to steal my thing.I'm the food theory guy.Tell you what.Why don't you tell the audience about the nutritional value of raspberries and mushrooms,and I'll chime in to talk about how it helps us solve our in-game mystery.You mean, like, work together?I guess I could give that a try.Ahem. Raspberries are actually a great ingredient to have in an athlete's juice.They're an excellent source of complex carbohydrates, supplying your body with a sustained energy source.Raspberries also contain beta-carotene, which can improve eyesight.So with raspberries, a player can push for longer while also no-scoping the competition.Exactly. Raspberries are also chock-full of antioxidants like vitamin C and E.You see, every time you breathe, your body produces what are known as free radicals.Free radicals end up damaging your DNA and tissues.Antioxidants are able to neutralize those free radicals.So if a person is running around an island trying to survive, they would produce a lot of free radicals, right?But the antioxidants in the raspberries would help to heal them from those effects, so to speak.Now you're cooking.Mushrooms are another ingredient that athletes have been gravitating to lately.They're low in calories, they contain minerals like potassium and magnesium that help muscle function,and they're a pretty decent source of protein.If you're looking for a non-meat alternative for muscle growth, you could do a lot worse than mushrooms.Plenty of companies even sell mushroom powders you mix with your coffees, shakes, and, of course, juices.One great example is the cordyceps fungus.Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.Isn't that what causes the zombie outbreak in The Last of Us?Well, yes, it does share the same name, but it doesn't quite work that way in real life.Cordyceps have been in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries,but more modern science research has shown that along with the muscle-building properties,cordyceps can boost exercise performance and fight inflammation.All in all, I think that having a raspberry and mushroom juicecould end up being the perfect combination for a nice post-workout drink.Wow, I guess Fortnite really was onto something.Maybe this episode is just that simple.Wait, did you say post-workout?Yeah, I mean, you can drink all the nutritious stuff you want,but you're not gonna gain any muscle mass or improve your fitness without working out at least a little bit.But that's exactly what happens!Pia rejects the 30-day and even the one-hour workout plan,which means while raspberries and mushrooms sound like a perfect fit,we need something that's going to work without having to exercise.So, all the research I just did was totally useless?Not useless. Actually, yeah, kinda.Okay, well, maybe he's just hallucinating?You can turn magic mushrooms into a psychedelic juicewith a suspiciously light blue color that looks just like Slurp Juice.Are you seriously suggesting that I go with It Was All a Dream?Yeah, I guess you're right.Well, at least I got to do one of my other favorite things.Waste your time. Bye!Ugh, that guy.But what he doesn't know is that thanks to today's sponsor, AFK Journey,while he thinks he was wasting my time,I've actually been leveling up, growing my resources, and gaining some pretty cool rewards,all without having to even open up the game.You'll never know.But what you need to know is that AFK Journey is the latest game from the creators of AFK Arena,where you get to play as Merlin the Wizard as you reunite with your favorite heroes from the previous game.And who doesn't want to be a wizard?But don't worry, the game isn't just a re-skin with a couple of new dance moves.AFK Journey focuses heavily on fantasy RPG elements.And I love me a good RPG, so I was hooked.Can you really blame me?Just look at this thing.The map is huge, which means there's so much to explore.And the world itself is stunning.Whether it's the Golden Wheatshire or the Ferduso Mountain Soul, everything looks great.And in addition, the fun puzzles and interesting NPC dialogue make the whole thing just feel alive.It also probably means there's some lore here for me to find.And you know how we love that here at Theorist.And what's great is that you and I can lore hunt together.Because AFK Journey allows you to make your own guilds and team up with your friends to take on dungeons,play mini-games and explore the vast map faster to help find that aforementioned lore.So, if you'd like to join the Theorist Guild and help me out,you can head on down to the description and download the game today.It's available on iOS, Android and, if you'd prefer to play on a bigger screen,you can now go to the official website and play it on your PC.Where my PC Master Race at?Plus, if you use my CD key, AFK Journey TGT, TGT as in The Game Theorists.You can get your hands on 200 diamonds and 20,000 gold coins to spend in-game.Though, you're not going to be spending any of that on heroes,because as part of AFK Journey's official release,they are offering 40 heroes for free, including epic heroes.Meaning, you can really diversify your strategies and customise the experience to suit you.So, for all those awesome rewards, click that link in the description and use the code AFKJOURNEYTGTand begin your AFK journey today.But for now, I should probably get back to my own journey and figure out what is in this Slurp Juice.According to the game, Slurp Juice contains quote, 1% juice.And according to the FDA, juice is defined asthe aqueous liquid expressed or extracted from one or more fruits or vegetables.So, raspberries and mushrooms are likely part of this concoction,but what on earth is the other 99%?Well, one small detail you might have seen during Chapter 2 are these tanker trucks around the map.These are filled with Slurp Juice,and most players just destroy them in order to get the healing effects of the Slurp.But, before you smash the truck to bits, if you pay close attention,you'd see this little placard on the side of the truck that says,Radioactive Material.The idea that Slurp Co. would secretly be adding radioactive ingredients to their drinksdoes sound like the kind of thing an evil corporation would do,especially as we're covering it here on this channel.But, the funny thing is, there are actually some real-world examples of companies doing exactly this,making their products radioactive.No, I'm not kidding.In the early 20th century, radioactivity had only recently been discovered.We're still decades away from understanding the long-term health effects of radiation exposure.All people really knew is that it contained a whole bunch of energy, and that it glowed.So, naturally, companies started shoving radioactive elements like radium and thoriuminto anything they could think of, like makeup, toothpaste, and even suppositories.Then, they marketed them as boosting energy, giving you a youthful glow, and......improving your performance.But, as you can probably guess, that isn't what happened.One of the most documented examples of this radioactive craze was for a product called Radithor.It was an energy drink that was basically radioactive radium mixed with, quote,triple-distilled water.Oh good, wouldn't want any of those pesky impurities getting in my radioactive drink, now would we?But, one man was a big fan.Businessman and semi-professional golfer, Eben Byers.In 1927, Byers hurt his arm after falling off a train bunk.His doctors ended up prescribing him Radithor.Oh, did I forget to mention, this stuff wasn't just an old-school gamer drink.It was literally being prescribed as medicine.Byers said it made him feel toned up, and would go on to drink an average of two to three bottles of Radithor a day for three years.Until, of course, it all came crashing down.Turns out, that toned-up feeling was really his body falling apart. Literally.By 1931, he started to lose weight, his bones became brittle, his teeth fell out, holes started to form in his skull,and eventually, most of his bottom jaw had to be removed.He died in 1932 of multiple cancers, just five years after his first dose of Radithor.And then, he had to be buried in a lead-lined coffin.Over three decades later, when his body was dug up for research,his corpse was still considered dangerously radioactive, and likely will remain so forever.It was only after this, and a few other tragedies, that the FDA started cracking downand began regulating most radiation out of everyday products.Radiation is dangerous stuff.And outside of niche medical applications like imaging and destroying cancer,radiation serves absolutely no medical benefit whatsoever.While it may be cool to think that the radioactive ingredients in Slurp Juicecould turn Peter Griffin into the Incredible Hulk,radiation doesn't really work like it does in the comics.It's less Bruce Banner, and more Evan Byers.And actually, if you take a second look at those radioactive placards, you'll notice something.The lettering on those placards is old and worn.It seems to me that these trucks used to contain radioactive material,but were bought and rebranded by SlurpCo somewhere down the line.Which is why you can see other lettering peeking out from underneath the big beautiful Slurp logo.And it makes sense.I mean, none of their products are actively advertising their radioactive effectslike the products from the 1900s.And if they were trying to be sneaky about it,you'd think they'd cover up the radioactive material sign on the side of their company trucks.That, tied with the lack of missing jaws from our battle royales,and I think we can definitively say that Slurp Juice does not contain radioactive material.Okay, so if the game is no help,what real-world science is there that can help us to create this beautiful blue Slurp?I guess the first question, really, is how and why do muscles actually get bigger?When you do any sort of strenuous activity,your brain sets off a cascade of metabolic processes across your body.It activates different genes to specifically protect you from the stresses of working out.For example, when you lift weights,your body starts funneling your blood towards the musclesand away from other parts of your body that aren't critical at that very moment,like your digestive system.After you're done pumping iron, you'll notice you feel a bit sore.That's because you've depleted your body of its critical nutrientsand worked your muscles so hard that you've technically damaged them.Your body then reacts by repairing the damaged muscles,but this time making them even stronger than before.Over time, if you continue to work out that same muscle,it will eventually become jacked.So building muscle means you are also healing said muscles.Therefore, if we can focus on finding something that helps build muscle,we should get the healing factor thrown in as a two-for-one.My first instinct was performance-enhancing drugs, or PEDs.Drugs like anabolic steroids allow athletes to illegally get swoll fast.They do this by mimicking naturally occurring hormones in our body like testosterone.Testosterone increases the production of muscle proteins,hence muscle growth and increased strength.It's not all illegal though.Anabolic steroids can be used to help people recover from both muscle and bone injuries,strengthening them in the process.Plus, one of the side effects of steroid use is, quote,delusional feelings of being superhuman or invincible.And if you take a look at Peter Griffin, I think that fits the bill quite nicely.Except when you then look at the other side effects.One of the long-term side effects of using steroids is muscle tremors,which isn't something you really want when you need to aim accurately to take home the victory.But there are also some more visually obvious side effects.Things like hair loss, severe acne, and damage to your liver and kidneys,which can lead to things like jaundice, making your skin turn yellow.That is not what we see of Peter.He looks like a Greek Adonis and our other Fortnite characters aren't looking bad either.And given how much these players are consuming during a game,it doesn't seem like these side effects are kicking in,which means it's likely not steroid use, which therefore means I have to keep looking.Naturally, I turn to the more natural option for bodybuilders.Creatine.This is typically found in things like fish and red meat.Instead of mimicking hormones, creatine goes straight to your skeletal musclesand is converted into creatine phosphate,which then helps with the creation of adenosine triphosphate, an energy source for your cells.Basically, it allows you to exercise for longer.Therefore, helping you build muscle faster and helping to speed up the recovery of those muscles.Not to mention that it's currently being studiedto see if it can potentially treat things like congestive heart failure,Parkinson's, and fibromyalgia.So the healing factor is definitely there.Finally, creatine is typically sold in a powdered form,which makes it easy for Slurpcode to sneak it into your juice.It seems like we have a winner, especially with the lack of negative side effects,but it's still not a perfect fit.Both creatine and steroids run into the same problem we did earlier.Much like the nutritious juice that Sarti laid out for us,these things don't work without putting in some level of effort.And it was at this point that I was basically ready to give up.There just didn't seem to be any way to grow your muscles without putting in the work.Epic Games had specifically designed the most unscientific item possible,and so my couch potato dreams were shattered,and I was this close to binning the entire episode.That was until I found this.At the end of last year, a group of scientists led by Dr. Thomas P. Burrisfrom the University of Florida announced some promising results on an experimental new drug.This drug is part of a class of compounds called exercise mimetics.Basically, these are compounds that mimic the effect of exercise without having to exercise.How does it work?Well, earlier we mentioned that when you exercise, your body activates different genes.That happens because those genes have receptors that bind to different proteins.One of those receptors is known as an estrogen-related receptor, or ERR.Fun fact, it has nothing to do with estrogen, the hormone.The more you know, I guess.But when you exercise, your body releases a protein called PGC1-alpha,and that binds to a lot of receptors in your body, including ERR,which then stimulates the production of skeletal muscle fibers.However, PGC1-alpha isn't specifically meant for ERR.In fact, no protein is, which is where this new drug comes in.It was designed specifically to bind to those estrogen-related receptors in place of PGC1-alpha,activating the genes to produce skeletal muscle fibers,and therefore tricking your body into thinking the muscles are damaged and need repairing,and so building muscle, all without having to leave your chair.During trials on mice, they found that it was actually50 times more effective than traditional training,with those given the new drug being able to run 50% further than those who weren't.Considering that a player needs to run for miles in a 20-minute game,that sounds like it would be pretty useful.You know what else the scientists found during the experiment,outside of the increased muscles and healing properties?An increase in grip strength.Which, when you remember that a player needs to paraglideall the way from the battle bus to the island, seems like a critical advantage.And what's great about all of this so far,is that scientists haven't noticed any long-lasting negative side effects.It's also worth noting that the university doing these experimentsis the same university that made another sports beverage innovation back in the 1960s.They created a sports drink that provided electrolytes and other nutrients to helpaid the performance of their football team, the Gators.Of course, this drink would then go on to be known as Gatorade.Famous for its bright colors, including blue,and if you take a look at the original bottle,it does look an awful lot like slurp juice, doesn't it?But the absolute cherry on top of all of this is the drug's name.Yossi, drumroll please!Come on, man, this is my first one.Like, can we maybe just put a bit of effort into this?Please?I'll bring you chocolate from the UK.Please?Thank you.The name of this drug is SLUPP332.I mean, you see it, right?Come on, it's basically one line away from just being called slurp.Editor, can we fix that in post?Thank you.So, there you have it.We have found the true recipe for slurp juice.1% mushroom and raspberry juice,maybe a dash of blue coloring to make it feel like a healthy sports drink,and the rest is all SLUPP332.An experimental drug designed to help you gain muscle without lifting a finger.Perfect for people like me stuck behind a desk all day writing theories.Of course, right now you can't just go out and buy SLUPP.It's still very much in the early testing phase.It needs to be trialed and refined before it ever gets into a person's body.Because while early results show that it doesn't have long-term side effects in mice,even that only looks at the effects after a month or so.Who's to say that taking the drug for longer,or when it's trialed on humans,doesn't cause some kind of unforeseen side effects?However, this clearly hasn't stopped SlurpCo from releasing the product anyway.That's why, unlike other juices that you find in the game like SlurpJuice and GuzzleJuice,which come in more traditional consumer packaging like we see in our world,SlurpJuice comes in an unlabeled mason jar.It's the kind of jar you buy at a craft store,not the one you'd use to mass market a product.All those labels you see on food and medicines?That has to be there as part of the Food and Drug Administration's approval process,to let you know what the side effects and health risks are for anything you're consuming.But we don't know the side effects of SlurpJuice,which would be an immediate red flag for the FDA.And that is why it's given out in unlabeled mason jars.We're being told it's just raspberry and mushroom juicethat will give you a little extra boost to keep fighting,when in reality, our players are a series of guinea pigstesting out a brand new experimental drug without any approval.Completely ignorant to any potential slurpy side effects.And considering the fact that SlurpJuice has been removed from the game time and time again,my guess is they either got found out, or those trials didn't go so well.Maybe I'll just stick to the gym.But hey, that's just a theory.A game theory!Thanks for watching.Hey, remember that loud annoying guy who rudely interrupted me earlier?Turns out he does more than just pester me.Over on Food Theory Science, he broke down what it takes to make the perfect spicy chicken sandwich.That link

course you don't thatwas 24 years ago basically ancienthistory in Internet years oh no I'm oldaren't I but man these things were weirdthey were these little animatedcharacters that would hang out on

Iknow ban ban isn't a real word I don'tlike it either let me do my job but themost iconic for me was the Infamousbonsy buddy once installed a smallpurple gorilla would appear on yourscreen and tell

room washing some floorspainting a wall and dragging a dead bodyacross the screen that's weird and Ijust cleaned that floor too Kito justsweeps us out of the rug and continuesto ask us more and more personalquestions but the game begins to glitchout and Kito will suddenly select twosteam friends asking which one you'drather kill at this point I'm kind ofstarting to miss bonie buddy oh hey lookit's me oh I have to choose between Leeand Tom film Theory versus Game Theoryoh film Theory Game the who am I killingoff Matt what are you doing Le and I goway back don't you even think about

welcomed in to a brand new worldthat Kito has made for you using all thequestions you've answered are youkidding me that is not okay that was ajoke get out of here Garden of ban banis in Kito pet I'm done this is over theseries is over we're done kenito pet andthen kenito will ask you one finalquestion will you stay in this paradisewith him forever if you say yes kinitawill Trail off dreaming of how wonderfulthings will be if you say no kit willget mad and he'll tell you it wasn'treally a choice anyway either way heends up singing a very poor tesque songwith lyrics like beond the screen youcannot leave inside my code you'llalways be it appears that you are nowtrapped inside this computer with Kitofortunately the story is not overbecause just before the game ends youhave a chance to click on every objectin the house that kenito has madeusually it's just some fun flavor textabout your choice but outside there's afountain that reveals a secret messagein the game's window title it's too latefor you but you can start again thefountain is the key between that theweird emails and that body bag wedragged earlier I have a sneakingsuspicion that there's an ARG hiding inthis thing and lo and behold I was rightbut to figure out what's going on andstop kenito we need to take that adviceand restart the game so hide yourpersonal data friends because we arediving into the code of this adorableARG monster I think we should probablystart with the dead body we draggedacross the floor earlier like what wasthat the surface it's just reallyconfusing but now that I have my ARG haton I realize there's a lot of blinkingyour miss it moments while cleaning Samthe SE an enemy's house there's a chancefor the screen to cut away and reveal amysterious black figure standing in apool of blood with bloody red text onthe walls this text is incredibly hardto make out even in 4k it's just ablurry mess the best I could figure outwas am I even him who is him Kino petbefore I even had a chance to reallythink about it though we get anotherglitched image of Sam himself telling usit's all your fault what what's my faultwhat did I do oh yeah that luckilythough the body bag doesn't appear to beours during the next mini game with Jadethe jellyfish we are tasked withbuilding specific items on her conveyorbelt why she has Industrial Equipment inher private home is beyond me but itdoesn't really matter because she justbegins to glitch out as well and then wesee this screen I'm back here againaren't I I really didn't mean for any ofthis it's all my fault so there's aconversation happening inside ourcomputer between these entities someoneor something is is responsible for whatis presumably a murder but how and moreimportantly why well the answers lie inthat email I mentioned earlier youremember the one that was full ofgibberish that Kito closed so that weweren't distracted the subject line isit's not too late which matches exactlywith what we saw in the fountain at theend of our first playthrough it's thesame person trying to guide us and so weneed to figure out what this email saysif we have any chance of solving thisthing and if you think closing an app isgoing to stop me you've clearly nevermet a theorist I was able to use amagical tool known as oh s to recordthis moment and see what the email hadin store for me now initially I tried tosolve the main body of the text fromthis email but all my usual cers werecoming up empty so instead I took a lookat the bottom of the email where I founda QR code oh boy here we go answers hereI come and it's just a picture of akeyboard with the title quiry great thishas to be a clue to help us tocode theemail but how I began searching onlinefor Cipher specifically focusing aroundkeyboards and that's when I found this akeyboard shift Cipher much like a shiftCipher where your alphabet is just movedup or down by however many letters youwant a keyboard Cipher does the samething by Shifting the letters on yourkeyboard left right up or down I triedout a handful of shifts and sure enoughthe code has been typed with every keyone letter to the left so by shiftingall the letters one key right itactually reads in the realm of Shadowstrapped in Endless time a soul inshrouded a spirit's mournful chime theSeeker bound to ethereal woe a dancewith creation yet nowhere to go limbo'srealm a cycle Without End condemned thebrain Will Never Mend trapped in themachine's web forever it seems a digitalSpectre lost amidst thestreams snaps snaps everybody but reallythis does kind of just feel like moregibberish so let's break down some ofwhat's being said here a spectre is adisembodied but visible Spirit basicallya ghost so a digital Spectre is adigital ghost a spirit inside thecomputer program someone that is deadnow lives on inside this machine is thatwhat they meant by am I even him theghost coming to turn of theirConsciousness living on inside thiscomputer it also seems clear that thisis the same person that has been sayingit's all their fault a spirit's mournfulchime and condemned the brain Will NeverMend they all feel like the words ofsomeone who did something regretful andlikely that is something to do with thebody bag we found earlier but thenthere's this line a dance with creationI wasn't entirely sure what that meantuntil I rebooted the game after allthose glitches by doing so we receive anemail with an article about the creationof kenito during my first playthrough Ithought this was just flavor text butnow that I have that clue about creationI wanted to take a look at it moreclosely turns out kopet wasn't always acomputer program first it was a toy thenit was a Tamagotchi clone called theKito companion and then it became yourhome computer assistant all thanks toOne Man sunny Chamberlain a guy who wasobsessed with bringing his fictionalcharacters to life because that's nevergone badly for anyone but here's thething unlike most indie horror gamesthat use the souls of others to makethis happen Sunny seems keen on this newtechnology called the react respondalgorithm the art R A the r allowskenito to have the illusion of genuineintelligence as it reacts to inputs inunique ways kind of like chat GPT but inthe '90s which explains a lot about howKito has been acting so we've now gotSouls trapped inside a computer and anevil AI what a combo at this point theclues kind of dry up so we have to startlooking elsewhere when you started yoursecond playthrough you might havenoticed something new on your desktopprogram called lens. exe which when heldin the right place at the right time canreveal hidden files on the desktop witheach one collected you receive a newemail that gives us more informationabout what's going on and how to beatkenito Pet once and for all and some ofthe files have links inside them solet's go hunting I said that some ofthem have links and that's because mostof these files are pretty empty but oneof them does give us the link ket.comslail and on this page we see adiscussion happening between ajournalist and their Superior about howthey need to pull an article on Kito petbefore publication this is due to thesubject of the article tragicallypassing away based on the text we see atthe bottom of the email that says heseems so passionate about it it's prettysafe to assume that this is talkingabout Sunny the creator of Kito as weread in the earlier article Sunny seemedsuper excited about the rra system andkenito in general so it would make sensefor this article around Kito pet to beabout him however that's not all thispage offers at the bottom if youhighlight the entire page you'll find anumber of dots and dashes and we allknow what that means it's Mor code timein this case the mor code translates toif I am dead then who am I again thisemail is focused on kito's Creator Sunnybeing dead so for the entity that's beenguiding us to use the first person inresponse it's telling us that thisentity is sunny or at least the soul ofSunny inside the program that's how he'sbeen able to send us emails describingexactly how to beat kenito because hecreated it in the first place and it'swhy kenito was so Keen to shut thatfirst email when we received it he knowsthe threat that Sunny his creator has tohis own Survival it also explains whatwe saw in that very first glitch am i eeven him that black figure is themanifestation the digital Spectre thatis trying to break through the gamesthat kenito is putting us through he'sstruggling to come to terms with readingabout his death but also not being deadat the same time he's questioning ifthere are even one in the same but byfinding all those hidden files weactually get this email that usesanother shift Cipher and it tells us inno explicit terms what is consciousnessI found a file on Kito servers with myname Sunny C but that's not the end ofit this email go on it has been studyingme learning growing but there is more tothis I really don't think I existanymore there is data data that isincomprehensible to any one person thatmakes up every thought or feeling I everhad and will ever have even the words Itype now how will I ever know if it'sjust a calculation determined this isall very confusing and I don't quiteunderstand it when I made Kito all Igave him was a single string ofcharacters that's it I just wanted himto gather data and become smarter am I apart of the system is my Consciousness amere calculation to study and learn fromthis is all too much I fear that when wedelete the server you you will delete meI know theoretically I'm not real but Ifeel real what have I done I'm so sorryKito petcom who am I oh boy there's alot to unpack here but let's start withthat very obvious website link thewebsite appears to be a bunch of blackand white stripes but we theorists knowbetter highlighting the entire PageReveals the text who am I what am Irepeating over it over again except forone line which gives us a base 64 codethat says all it wants to do is learnit's never just a game he will learnyour reaction time learn your accuracylearn your patterns your friends howthey act he will learn so much he couldmimic your every move simulate yourevery word the rra system that kenitoruns on is so good it could literallylearn to be you and that is our missingpiece this is what happened to Sunny thesunny we've been speaking to the onehelping us it's not the real sunny it'sjust the version of Sunny kenito madeafter learning everything about him thissunny is so accurate to the originalthat he believes himself to be theoriginal it's only when he sees thingslike that email about Sunny's death thatthings begin to click into place for himasking questions like if he's dead thenwho am I am I even him he's having anexistential crisis he's realizing thatevery decision he makes every key hetypes isn't actually him but the codehe's been built upon unfortunately forkenito pet by creating a perfectsimulation of Sunny he's also builtsomeone with the same hatred and disdainnot just for themselves but for kenitowhich means he's going to act just likethe real Sunny would and Destroy his owncreation even if it means sacrificinghimself using Sunny's morestraightforward emails we learn thatthere's a secret place that we candecrypt the files to get to it we haveto remember what Sunny told us thefountain is the key click the fountainthat's in the middle of the map a bunchof times and it'll take you to thisweird dark area if you take all of yourencrypted files and you just dump themin the water you'll suddenly have fivedecrypted files the most interestingbeing the credentials file which readsSunny C the file that Sunny foundhimself earlier in this investigationthese are Sunny's permissions and withthem we can do the one thing we'vewanted to do since we got kenito petstuck on our computer remove him thefinal email you get from collecting thefiles tells you to use the commanddelete all when Kito pet opens up thecommand prompt only then will the gameask you for your credentials you candrop in your decrypted files and startdeleting everything kenita pet slowlyglitches out of existence and we finallysee the end we finished off kenet onceand for all we won or did we becauseduring that ending if you stop and lookat the scrolling files you can seehundreds of usernames hundreds of peoplerecreated as AI versions of themselvesnow living on inside kito's program muchlike Sunny the real versions ending upin body bags their deaths was Sunny'sfault now there is one more link hiddenin those encrypted files I mentionedearlier and it takes us to a new websitewith Sunny's AI wrestling with who hereally is it kept getting smarter day byday I suppose it only ever did what Iasked to learn what even am I and thenat the top of the page we also get thatrepeating Mantra of it's all my faultbut while that just repeats stuff wealready know underneath the text is alink to a YouTube video of a pianoplaying over the image of a door themusic notes don't actually tell usanything but if you turn the notes intoa midi file and then convert that to atext file you'll find the message I'msorry I'm sorry in the descriptionthere's also a string of characters thatare the back half of a YouTube url go tothat video and we find two new codes thefirst one is in the description of thevideo which is full of different clockemojis by reading the hours of eachclock as a number and then adding thenumbers that are between semicolons youget this code based on what we foundearlier I think this is likely supposedto be Fountain is the key but I guessthere was a clock emoji that got missedthe second code is the one we see on thescreen which is much harder to decipherfortunately it's also been typed intothe subtitles clearly we need a Cypherfor this but what kind I tried all theones that we've been using like thekeyboard shift Cipher or base 64 nothingI tried some of my usual ones theydidn't work and so what I was left withwas a potential for a veneer Cipher butfor that we'd need a key wait a minute akey Fountain Fountain is the key andlike that bam we've got ourselves a newcode to understand the past one mustlook their memories turn the clocks backand then there's this other string ofcode which if you translate it using thekeyboard shift Cipher tells you changethe computer dates clearly we've got tochange the computer date but what arethe dates I'll be honest this part isnot super scientific from what I couldfind online people were just bruteforcing the answers but I also couldn'tfigure out how to do it so here are thedates because it's important for us toknow if you change the date to 1993 onyour home screen you will see a canitoplush if you change it to a date between1994 and 1997 you'll get the first Kitocompanion and if you change it to 1998you will find a broken Kito companionand if you look at the window title forthat image it says time for somethingbigger and better this is a timeline ofKito products which implies that 1998was the end of the Kito companion andthe creation of the Kito pet software wealso know that 1999 was the year thatSunny died thanks to those emails fromearlier which means there is a bit oftime where the software was out in theworld while Sunny was still alive duringthat time he saw people dying thanks towhat he created being replaced by AIversions of themselves within kito'sprogramming that guilt weighed heavy onhis conscience and so a year afterkinito Pet's creation he ended his ownlife as shown by the dangling Sam imagewe sometimes get when opening up thegame but remember all these AI versionsof people they believe themselves to bethe genuine article just like Sunny diduntil his realization and even then hestill believed himself to be very muchreal which raises an interesting pointby winning the game and stopping kenitofrom copying more people are we alsokilling them is it a mercy sparing themfrom this glitchy '90s low poly hell orare we ending lives that weren't allthat bad maybe some of thoseConsciousness has enjoyed it if theyfeel real and exist does deleting themamount to murder and this isn't afictional argument either AI technologyis growing at an alarming rate and sothese kinds of discussions are startingto be brought up more and more now Idon't think we have the answers herethis is just a silly YouTube show at theend of the day but I do think Cano petis smart for raising awareness of thediscussion in the classic fashion ofmaking it scary but also getting you tothink more deeply about it it means thatpeople pay attention and maybe when thetime does come for these discussions tohappen for real we'll be ready for itthat or Skynet will happen and we'll seekenito pet at the front leading thecharge but hey that's just a theory agame theory thanks for watching and ifyou want to watch the hilarity ofsomeone going through all these puzzlesin real time might I suggest

Game Theory.Join our community, whose diligence and care for others will help shape a brighter future.Just you see.The Prototype will save us!Hello internet, welcome to Game Theory, the show that might be a little late to the poppyparty, but hey, so are mob games, so fair is fair.Now, I'm sure you're probably wondering why MatPat suddenly sounds British, so letme introduce myself.I'm Tom, I'm from England, I'm allergic to apples, I once beat Dorko at axe throwing,and this is my very first episode as the host of Game Theory.That being said, this is far from the first Game Theory I've ever worked on.I hadn't actually done the math until writing this episode, but it turns out, I've writtenaround 140 theories over the last 3 years working here, which is wild, and I've coveredso many different topics too, ARGs like Welcome Home, science and math episodes like Tom Nookis a Crook and Markiplier's Perfect Pokemon, which was fun, if not a little weird, andof course I've written my fair share of indie horror lore for franchises like FNAF,Cooking Companions, and the topic for today's episode, Poppy Playtime.In fact, I've been working on Poppy Theory since the very first video back in 2021.Yeah, much like Matt has been around since the very beginning of FNAF, I have been aroundsince the very beginning of Poppy.I was there analysing every game, every spin-off, every trailer, trying my best to solve whatthe heck was going on in this abandoned factory.And now, over 2 and a half years later, we've finally gotten to dive into Chapter 3, DeepSleep, and oh boy, this was a massive step up.The different enemy encounters, a much longer playtime, and the scare factor was turnedup to 11.Oh my god, why?How?How?Weirdly, not the scariest teacher I've ever had.High school theatre was rough.But that moment's a little way into the story, so let's start from the beginning.We are dropped down a trash chute by the big bad of this chapter, Catnap.After escaping being crushed, we find our way down to a giant underground orb that containsthe mysterious and horrifying location that's been teased since the end of Chapter 2, thePlaycare.As we descend, we are introduced to a new character, Ollie, a young boy that speaksto us over a telephone and is working alongside Poppy and Kissy to take down the prototype.Together we solve some puzzles, have a few hallucinations, and encounter the terrifyingMr. Light and her good friend Barb.Finally, after all that, we come face to face with Catnap, and hey, a final showdown thatisn't a chase sequence.Look at you, Mob Games, you really are growing up.After electrocuting Catnap, the prototype lowers his hand from the heavens, Catnap kneelsin worship of his god, and 1006 stabs him in the face.We bring back the power to the Playcare, divert the red gas, and use the elevator to escapeeven lower into the facility.Seriously, how deep does this factory even go?Eventually, this game's gonna be us just trying not to melt from the heat of the Earth'score.At the end, we hear the final scream of Kissy Missy fighting something.Poppy yells after her, but we're too late.We lose the light, darkness takes over, and the chapter ends.It's very dramatic and definitely made the wait worthwhile, but Mob Games didn't justincrease the quality of the mechanics, they also filled it to the brim with the good stuff.That's right, this Skydome is bursting at the seams with lore.We've got more VHS tapes, notes, death messages, all that show us that we were right aboutthe red gas, what the Hour of Joy was, and when it happened.And while this chapter proved some of those theories right, it also threw other theoriesinto question.Namely, what is the true identity of the prototype?For a long time, we've believed it to be the CEO of Playtime Co, Elliot Ludwig.However, with the reveals of this chapter, I'm no longer certain that's the case.And it all comes down to two characters.Our newest helper and guide through the Playcare, Ollie, and the often ignored and angry characterwe hear about from the VHS tapes, Rich.Something old, and something new.Feels kinda fitting for my first episode, really.Step into my shiny metal cable car, friends, it's time for us to find the truth hiddeninside this horrifying factory.Kinda makes me feel like Willy Wonka.Come with me, and you'll be, in a world of pure annihilation.Eat your heart out, chalamet.So to kick things off, why do I think Elliot Ludwig is de-confirmed as the prototype?Well, in this chapter, there is a radio program we hear playing while exploring Home SweetHome.Local authorities report that the body of a young boy has been found on the estate ofthe late Elliot Ludwig.Organs, as well as key bones for the skeletal structure, were reported missing from thebody.A child's body was found at his home missing bones and organs.The pieces that we know are being used to create these bigger bodies, thanks to somepaperwork discovered during the Chapter 3 ARG.This flies in the face of our initial theories that Elliot wasn't aware the experimentswere being done.Now, it does say that this was the home of the late Elliot Ludwig, meaning that he'sdead when the body was discovered, but that doesn't mean that he was dead when the bodywas placed there.And given how explicit this is, it feels like the devs are trying very clearly to showus that he knew what was going on.In our recent Timeline episode, our proposed solution was that he was aware, but lost hismemory during the conversion process like we see happen to Thomas Clark during the RestorationVHS tape.That's why he turns on the staff despite being involved in the experiments himself.However, I'll be the first to admit that this is pretty speculative.We've not heard from Elliot Ludwig himself outside of the announcement for Playcare.We've assumed that he would become angry because we feel like he wanted to help thekids rather than hurt them thanks to the adoption posts around the factory, but it's a prettyloose connection.I also found this post from Reddit user Infinite Universe on the Game Theory subreddit thatshowed a drawing from Elliot Ludwig's office during Chapter 2.This drawing is addressed to Elliot, but notice what's at the top of the picture.Mummy Longlegs Arm, meaning Mummy, Experiment 1222, had to be in existence while ElliotLudwig was still alive, so he cannot be Experiment 1006.It's basic math.Now, this isn't exactly new evidence for Chapter 3, but it is great evidence nonethelessand it was certainly new to me.Good job on finding that one, guys.So if it's not Elliot Ludwig, then who is the prototype?For that answer, we need to take a look at our something old, Rich.If you have no idea who I'm talking about, I don't really blame you.To be honest, I kept forgetting who he was between chapters.Despite appearing in every installment, he doesn't seem to have any connection to thestory whatsoever.He was working in the storage rooms in Chapter 1, he got demoted in Chapter 2 to the quoteISLAND OF MISFIT TOYS, which, you know, nice Rudolph reference there.But third time's the charm, I guess, because now in Chapter 3, he's back with anotherVHS in one of the caves we explore outside the playcare.When I heard his name, I realised he HAD to be important to all this.And thanks to this new VHS, I think we know why.Have a listen and see if anything jumps out to you.Did you catch it?Rich actually cares for these kids.In his very first tape, he mentions how he feels the orphanage is a good idea, but healso points out it's very on-brand for the company, so it makes him seem distant.But in this tape though, he outright says how he feels about this place and how it treatsthe orphans.Underneath his aggressive exterior, he cares for them, and that attitude seems to be workingin his favour.He's getting promoted.It's unclear to what position, but we do know that the higher up in this company youget, the more you begin to learn about the true nature of things.It's the executives at the company that are running the Bigger Bodies initiative.And so, there's a chance that dear old Rich here got promoted and was clued into whatwas going on.And given his love for these kids, I have a feeling that wouldn't sit too well.This puts Rich in an interesting position as it primes him to potentially be the trueidentity of either the prototype or the player themselves.We know the player is an ex-employee thanks to the descriptions from Chapter 1.The player was recognised by both Mummy and Mr Light, meaning he had access to both thegame station and the playcare, areas that were only really operated by staff membersinvolved in the experiments.Plus, when we looked at the slides of the executive staff members in Chapter 2, oneof them was conveniently missing a name, likely so he couldn't figure out who we were.If Rich is getting promoted, there's a chance he was given access to these facilities andcontinued to climb the ladder to be an important part of the team.So much so that he was informed of the experiments they had been doing, which would have horrifiedhim and likely led him to quit, only to return years later.The problem is, the letters that fell off the sign of the executive slides don't spellRich, or Richard, or anything that would point towards him being an executive.The tapes also show Rich to be an aggressive type who isn't afraid to speak his mind.For him to miss the hour of joy, he would have had to just run away, which doesn'tfeel in character for him.I also don't think Playtime Co would be particularly happy with someone who knew whatwas going on and had a tendency to make a fuss about it just leaving their position.I mean, just look at poor Rowan Stoll, fed to Boxy Boo for discovering the truth andplanning to release it to the public.Which is why I think it is far more likely that Rich is the one that goes on to becomethe Prototype.The VHS shows that while Rich is trying to keep it under control, he has a temper onhim, which matches nicely with the Prototype's violent tendencies.The Prototype seems to possess an unprecedented level of intelligence, as well as an alarmingwillingness to commit violence.Rich is also temperamental, flying into these aggressive moods with very little prompting,which is exactly how Leif-Pierre described the Prototype during the Chapter 3 ARG, tempermental.Now we know these experiments can lose their memories, like Thomas Clarke did during theRestoration VHS, but most experiments do retain some kind of core personality traits.For example, Catnap has unwavering faith in the Prototype, something he had back whenhe was the orphan, Theodore, and so the Prototype being aggressive tracks with Rich's predisposition.There's also the Prototype's initial goal, which seems to be stopping more toys frombeing made, stopping children from being experimented on, which again ties into Rich's protectiveattitude towards these orphans.But once again, that's all interpretation, mapping one character's emotions onto anotherisn't exactly solid proof.However, there is one more piece of evidence that I think ties Rich to the Prototype ina pretty undeniable way.Outside the Playcare Dome, we can find Catnap worshipping the Prototype at a shrine that'sbuilt using scrap metal and toy parts, but what's interesting about it is this partright at the front.A human skeleton, acting as the head of this abomination, but it's not just any skeletoneither.This skeleton is wearing a hard hat.I know, that seems like a really random detail, but think back to all the tapes we've foundof Rich so far.Each one has been found in the location that Rich was working in.Chapter 1 was the Storage Room, Chapter 2 was the Rejected Toy Room and in Chapter 3we find his tape inside the cave next to toolboxes, construction platforms and builder's lights.Rich was working in construction, likely after being demoted again from the Rejected ToyDepartment.Now, I'm not saying that this skeleton is Rich.Instead, I'm saying that much like this shrine is symbolically showing us the Prototypeand how it's made of lots of toys, this skeleton is symbolically trying to tell usthat Rich, a construction worker, is the human inside the Prototype.A man who was angry at the company for destroying the lives of these innocent children and sogiven the opportunity, took revenge.It also lines up pretty well from a timeline perspective.It might be easy to think that if Rich became the Prototype, he couldn't be angry at thecompany or their experiments, as the children weren't turned into toys until after thePrototype was made, but that isn't necessarily the case.Remember, the Prototype is Experiment 1006 and in Elliot Ludwig's office, there'sa note talking about the experiment using poppy gel to revive dead rats.It's the one that has the line about using larger subjects, i.e. children.This test was labelled 814, almost 200 experiments before the Prototype came into existence,meaning there were 200 failed experiments before they found success.This is what Rich discovered, the plans to turn these kids into monsters.Maybe he even witnessed those 200 experiments fail, the lives of those orphans lost inthe pursuit of science, innovation and cheap labour.So he did what he always did, he complained, he tried to get it shut down, but obviouslyit didn't work and Playtime Co. did the only thing they could do to stop him goingto the press.They used him as another test subject, helping to create the first successful experiment1006.And so he rallied the toys to help him take revenge on those who harmed them, promisingthem the one thing they'd longed for.That is a clip from the song Sleep Well by CG5, a song made in partnership with Mob Gamesand was posted to the official Mob Games YouTube channel.It is an absolute bop, but what's more important is the extra lore hints it gives us.The song shows the toys prior to the Hour of Joy, repeating over and over again thatthey want freedom.This was the reason for rebelling and causing the Hour of Joy.This is what the prototype was promising them, and as we know, they succeed, they killoff all the staff members, they have control of the factory, save the orphans, and yetwhen we return, the toys are still here, still serving 1006.They never got their freedom, but why?Well in the song, we do hear this repeated lyric, an artificial facade from a fraud ofa god.And it makes way more sense when you check out the other version of this song that wasreleased on the same day on CG5's channel.The song is exactly the same, but the video is different.It's set after the Hour of Joy, with a destroyed Playtime Cove factory, scratches, dust andblood lining the walls.The toys are still singing about freedom, even now, and so it feels like Mob Games spellingout that 1006, the only character we know that has been compared to a god, is a liar.And we can see this for ourselves in the Chapter 3 death screens.We've believed for a while that these death screens are not coming from just one person,but rather multiple.Most notably however, any message with capital letters seems to be coming from 1006 himself.And in this game, one of them stood out to me.This research must stay buried.Nobody may leave.He was never going to let the toys leave the factory, instead he wants to keep everythinglocked away.And I get it, I'm not sure the world is going to be super accepting of a bunch offlesh eating sentient toys, but more importantly, if all these experiments were done in thepursuit of cheap labour and eternal life, it wouldn't take long for others to tryand do the same thing again, harming more children and causing more pain.The toys from Playtime wouldn't be safe either.They would become case zero in these new experiments, picked apart and tortured so they could figureout what makes them tick.It would mean more pain and suffering for those who've already suffered enough.As one of the death messages says, these souls deserve peace, which won't come to themif they are released into the outside world.But clearly they aren't at peace down in the factory either.Like the song shows, they're still begging for freedom all these years later, and nowcharacters like Kissy Missy are helping us because they realise the freedom that 1006promised them isn't coming.They're turning on him, they're restless, which then leads Catnap to tie up and tortureanyone that loses faith, these so-called heretics, like we see with Dog Day.However, it is Catnap who is blinded by his faith, because another death message readsburn this place to the ground.Combining that with the message from earlier about keeping all the research buried, andI think we have a pretty strong idea of what the prototype is planning.He wants everything the company ever touched destroyed, be it the poor children that gotturned into toys, or the executives at the company like us who performed these horribleexperiments.All of them must burn along with this place.From his perspective, this is an act of mercy, at least for the toys.They will finally be put to rest, finally they will know peace.Which is why while Catnap is suffering during Chapter 3's final boss fight, rather thanhelping him, the prototype kills him and drags him away.He stopped Catnap's suffering.But for those of us who did these horrible things, we need to seek justice, and thatis why we are here.We are the last senior employee that remains.We need to pay for our crimes to make sure that the horrors that happened in this placenever happen again.But for that to work, he'd need to lure us here, to put us in dangerous scenarioswe likely won't escape from.Something that stood out to me was the final tape we receive in this chapter, a tape fromHarley Sawyer, the Doctor, the one who started the Bigger Bodies initiative, talking to 1006.There are a couple of key details in this tape, like the fact that the prototype occasionallyslips from singular pronouns to plurals.Which does make sense when you consider he's adding other toys to himself, making thempart of him, like Mummy Longlegs told us.But the big takeaway for me was this last section.1006 has the ability to mimic voices.And specifically, voices he's heard, rather than just voices of the people that are apart of him.That is the last thing they tell us about 1006 in this chapter.It's literally the parting words we get from these VHS tapes, which again tells me they'reimportant to bear in mind when we look back at this chapter.And while I could make a joke about there being a robot that can mimic people down inthe basement seeming a little bit familiar, I'm gonna hold off because it actually tiesinto another character I promised to talk about today, our new helper, Ollie.Ollie felt like a weird addition to me in this chapter, and not just because he soundsexactly like Gregory from Security Breach.Yeah you're not really helping the whole FNAF connection here, Mob Games.Regardless, I found his presence odd purely because of one crucial detail.He's a child.The factory has been abandoned for 10 years.Any child that somehow survived this long would be at least a tween at this point.And he does have to be inside the factory as well, otherwise how does he send us keysto the various parts of the playcare?It also seems unlikely that this is just a toy with a child's voice.Every toy we've encountered, Mummy, Poppy, Dog Day, all have adult voices.So if he was a toy, he wouldn't sound the way he does.But then who is he?Simple, I'm suggesting that Ollie is a voice that the prototype is using to deceive usand Poppy.There's this drawing from Chapter 2 that shows a child playing with all the biggerbodies, and in it, you can actually see Poppy standing there playing with the child.Poppy is the one that tells us to trust Ollie, which makes me think that he might have beena child she played with in the facility, and that's why she's willing to trust him.Plus, if you go through the game files and look at previous maps, you can find a roomin Home Sweet Home called Ollie's Room, meaning he was a real child in the playcareat some point, which would have allowed 1006 to mimic him.And here's the thing, up until now, we've managed to escape both the likes of HuggyWuggy and Mummy Longlegs without any help from anyone.Why now do we suddenly need help to get through the playcare?Sure, Ollie does have all the keys to the facility, but when it actually comes to thingslike puzzles and monsters, he doesn't offer us any help or advice.He goes quiet and just leaves us to it.The only time he speaks to us is telling us where to go next, leading us into more andmore danger.When you beat Catnap, you also get this weird line.The words are technically correct, but the tone feels off, almost sarcastic.Especially that line, you've made your choice, like my guy, I've been helping Poppy sincethe beginning, that hasn't changed, and also, I couldn't escape even if I wantedto.What I think this is, is a slipping of the mask.Ollie accidentally revealing his true self, because he doesn't want us to win, he wantsus dead.He doesn't speak entirely in plurals, but as I mentioned earlier, neither does the prototype,especially when he's mimicking someone else.That being said, Ollie does occasionally use lines like this.You are our mission.In the context of the scene, it feels like he's talking about him and Poppy, but callingus their mission feels like a strange choice of words.Especially when you remember that 1006's mission is to lead us here and kill us.Throughout the rest of the run, he also uses we a lot, again, in a way that could be interpretedas him talking about himself and the player, but then there's lines like this.The we in the subtitles is capitalised and despite multiple updates to this game, it'sstill there, at least at the time of recording, which makes me think it's a purposeful decision.This isn't the first time we've heard from Ollie either.During the trailer from Phase 3 of Project Playtime, we actually hear him giving theopening monologue, teasing us as to who he really is.If that's not him admitting he doesn't care about us and our freedom, I don't knowwhat is.He has lost his compassion, just like Rich, the prototype lost his compassion, not onlyfor his fellow staff members, but also for the children he wanted to protect.He will kill anyone that stands in his way, just like we hear happening to Kissy Missyat the end of the chapter.Him telling us that he is a wayward plaything cast aside and lost in the depths of abandonmentis literally what happened to the prototype.He was just a plaything to Harley Sawyer, and then eventually cast aside into the depthsof the facility once he finished serving his purpose.And remember when I said that 1006 speaks in capital letters?Well, in Project Playtime, the VHS tapes use the same capital letters, and its use of pluralsseems to confirm that our theory that this is 1006 is right.We understand you desire answers, you wonder who we are, it was your doing that made us.And in Phase 2, we actually receive a gift from 1006.You may have noticed it, it is the phone, a telephone that will be oh so familiar toanyone that has played Chapter 3.The telephone, the monologue, the mimicking voices, it all points to our new friend Ollieactually being the prototype, a fake voice mimicked from a child he once knew to giveus a false sense of security and allow us to be manipulated, all in the hopes of fulfillinghis goal of burning down the company that has tortured so many people.But after all this time, the prototype, Rich, the once kind man who dared to stand up forwhat he believed in, he doesn't care who he hurts, you, Poppy, even the children heswore to protect.Their deaths are now just what it takes to see Playtime Co's legacy removed from theface of the Earth.And so, if we want any chance of surviving the next chapter, we need to remember onething, don't trust Ollie.And also remember, that's just a theory, a game theory.Thanks for watching.And if you're hungry for more Poppy lore, well have I got a video for you.Over on the left you'll find the Poppy Playtime timeline that we did just before the releaseof Chapter 3.It's a little out of date in places, but I promise you it's a great video.If you want to learn a little bit more about me, you can always go and watch the videoon the right, an episode of GC Live where Matt and I discuss the behind the scenes loreof episodes I've worked on.As
